BUSINESS\nOverview\nUber Technologies, Inc. (\u201cUber,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and\nproduct expertise to power movement from point A to point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our\nplatform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d). We connect consumers (\u201cRider(s)\u201d) with independent providers of ride services (\u201cMobility Driver(s)\u201d) for ridesharing\nservices, and connect Riders and other consumers (\u201cEater(s)\u201d) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, \u201cMerchants\u201d) with delivery service providers\n(\u201cCouriers\u201d) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \u201cend-user(s)\u201d or \u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Mobility\nDrivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as \u201cDriver(s).\u201d We also connect consumers with public transportation networks. We use this same network,\ntechnology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers (\u201cShipper(s)\u201d) with carriers (\u201cCarrier(s)\u201d) in the freight industry by providing Carriers\nwith the ability to book a shipment, transportation management and other logistics services. Uber is also developing technologies designed to provide new solutions\nto solve everyday problems.\nOur technology is available in approximately 70 countries around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe\n(excluding Russia), the Middle East, Africa, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia).\nOur Segments\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had three operating and reportable segments: Mobility, Delivery and Freight. Mobility, Delivery and Freight platform offerings\neach address large, fragmented markets.\nMobility\nOur Mobility offering connects consumers with a wide range of transportation modalities, such as ridesharing, carsharing, micromobility, rentals, public\ntransit, taxis, and more\u2014helping customers go almost anywhere they need. We believe our global leadership position\u2014and the vast amount of marketplace data\nthat comes along with it\u2014means that we have the best technical and data platform to innovate faster than other companies with similar products.\nWe believe our scale and global availability allows our Mobility segment to offer better consumer experiences to riders in a variety of vehicle types, providing\nconsumers with higher reliability and Drivers with better earnings opportunities. Mobility also includes activity related to our financial partnerships products and\nadvertising. We also participate in certain regions through our minority-owned entities.\nDelivery\nOur Delivery offering allows consumers to search for and discover the best of local commerce\u2014from restaurants to grocery, alcohol, convenience and other\nretailers\u2014order a meal or other items, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have it delivered. We refer to the grocery, alcohol, convenience, and retail categories\ncollectively as Grocery & Retail. After launching our Delivery app, Uber Eats, over eight years ago, we believe our Delivery offering increases consumer\nengagement with the Uber platform overall, which in turn results in broader reach for our Merchants who can attract Uber Eats consumers from Uber without\nincreasing their own costs. For Drivers, we believe the Delivery offering leverages, and has expanded, our earner base by increasing utilization and earnings across\nthe network. We also believe it also attracts new Drivers to the platform who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles. Over the last several years, our\nDelivery business has expanded to include Uber Direct, our white-label Delivery-as-a-Service offering to retailers and restaurants around the world, as well as\nadvertising opportunities.\nFreight\nWe believe that Freight is revolutionizing the logistics industry. Freight powers a managed transportation and logistics network and connects Shippers and\nCarriers in a digital marketplace to move shipments while leveraging our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizing industries.\nFreight provides an on-demand platform to automate and accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end while providing visibility and control of logistics networks.\nFreight connects Carriers with Shippers\u2019 shipments available on our platform, and gives Carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment\nwith the touch of a button. Freight serves Shippers ranging from small- and medium-sized businesses to global enterprises. By leveraging logistics solutions\nexpertise and value-add solutions, Freight enables Shippers to create and tender shipments, secure capacity on demand with real-time pricing, and track those\nshipments from pickup to delivery. Freight operations are principally based in North America and Europe. We believe that all of these factors represent significant\nefficiency improvements over traditional transportation management and freight brokerage providers.\nPlatform Synergies\nOur Platform\nThe foundation of our platform is our massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise.\n4", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5207, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "57d791ed-5d39-4ecc-8b04-b36150569999": {"__data__": {"id_": "57d791ed-5d39-4ecc-8b04-b36150569999", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4ce881d4-cadb-496d-a8b9-14ba34d120d2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "968e4fa61f47bdaab5b7c2e36b45631c5223755e005d1eddc4984deb59c528c8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4714cc7e-888d-44cb-8eae-134440832783", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5c64527ccb219b28a298144b5920283264ce97248faadc761e28c9b53584aefc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Together, these elements power movement from point A to point B.\nMassive Network Our massive, efficient, and intelligent network consists of tens of millions of Drivers, consumers, Merchants, Shippers and\nCarriers, as well as underlying data, technology, and shared infrastructure. Our network becomes smarter with every trip. In\nmore than 10,000 cities around the world (as of December 31, 2023), our network powers movement at the touch of a button\nfor millions, and we hope eventually billions, of people.\nLeading TechnologyWe have built proprietary marketplace, routing, and payments technologies. Marketplace technologies are the core of our deep\ntechnology advantage and include demand prediction, matching and dispatching, and pricing technologies. Our technologies\nmake it extremely efficient to launch new businesses and operationalize existing ones.\nOperational ExcellenceOur regional on-the-ground operations teams use their extensive market-specific knowledge to rapidly launch and scale\nproducts in cities, support Drivers, consumers, Merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, and build and enhance relationships with\ncities and regulators.\nProduct ExpertiseOur products are built with the expertise that allows us to set the standard for powering movement on-demand, provide\nplatform users with a contextual, intuitive interface, continually evolve features and functionality, and deliver safety and trust.\nWe intend to continue to invest in new platform offerings that we believe will further strengthen our platform and existing offerings.\nWe believe that all of these synergies serve the customer experience, enabling us to attract new platform users and to deepen engagement with existing\nplatform users. Both of these dynamics grow our network scale and liquidity, which further increases the value of our platform-to-platform users. For example,\nDelivery attracts new consumers to our network\u2014for the three months ended December 31, 2023, over 60% of first-time Delivery consumers were new to our\nplatform. Additionally, for the three months ended December 31, 2023, consumers who used both Mobility and Delivery generated 10.5 Trips per month on\naverage, compared to 5.0 Trips per month on average for consumers who used a single offering in cities where both Mobility and Delivery were offered. We\nbelieve that these trends will improve as we further leverage the power of our platform.\nWith our platform, we are making it even easier for our consumers to unlock convenience. In 2020, we rolled out our \u201cSuper App\u201d view on iOS and Android,\nwhich combines our multiple offerings into a single app and is designed to remove friction for our consumers. During November 2021, we launched Uber One in\nthe United States as our single cross-platform membership program that brings together the best of Uber. Uber One members have access to discounts, special\npricing, priority service, and exclusive perks across our rides, delivery and grocery offerings. Since then, we have expanded Uber One to approximately 25\ncountries. Our Eats Pass membership program continues to remain available in select cities as a subscription offering. Our membership programs are designed to\nmake utilizing our suite of products a seamless and rewarding experience for our consumers. We exited 2023 with 19 million members for our Uber One, Eats Pass\nand Rides Pass membership programs.\nWe are also utilizing our data and scale to offer marketplace-centric advertising to connect merchants and brands with our platform network and unlocking\ncross-platform advertising formats. During October 2022, we officially launched Uber\u2019s advertising division and introduced Uber Journey Ads, an engaging way\nfor brands to connect with consumers throughout the entire ride process. We now offer a model that enables brands to partner with Uber on a variety of advertising\noptions on the Uber and Uber Eats apps, and beyond, while connecting with consumers in brand-safe and captivating ways. We also provide comprehensive\nreporting and analysis, which helps brands fine-tune their understanding of consumers and create more impactful campaigns as they connect with consumers at\nrelevant points throughout their journeys and transactions. During the fourth quarter of 2023, active advertising merchants exceeded 550,000. We believe that our\nadvertising further strengthens the power of our platform and will continue to do so as we onboard more advertisers.\nCompetitive Environment\nWe compete on a global basis in highly fragmented markets. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the\nlogistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from\nnew market entrants given the low barriers to entry that characterize these industries. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as\nexisting products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5021, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4714cc7e-888d-44cb-8eae-134440832783": {"__data__": {"id_": "4714cc7e-888d-44cb-8eae-134440832783", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4ce881d4-cadb-496d-a8b9-14ba34d120d2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "968e4fa61f47bdaab5b7c2e36b45631c5223755e005d1eddc4984deb59c528c8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "57d791ed-5d39-4ecc-8b04-b36150569999", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "706ea1c15be34d0b0a8e8142c39eae8fa139bae9b486e2e652c94fa0979fb837", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We also provide comprehensive\nreporting and analysis, which helps brands fine-tune their understanding of consumers and create more impactful campaigns as they connect with consumers at\nrelevant points throughout their journeys and transactions.

As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as\nexisting products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. While we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings\nacross a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop\nspecialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do. The competition we face in each of our offerings includes:\n\u2022Mobility. Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of passenger miles in the markets\nthat we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. In addition,\npublic transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in many cities.

Our Delivery offering competes with numerous companies in the meal, grocery and other delivery space in various regions for drivers,\nconsumers, and merchants, including Amazon, Deliveroo, Delivery Hero, DoorDash, iFood, Instacart, Just Eat Takeaway, and Rappi. Our Delivery\noffering also competes with restaurants, including those that offer their own delivery and/or take-away, meal kit delivery services, grocery delivery\nservices, and traditional grocers.\n\u2022Freight. Our Freight offering competes with global and North American freight brokers and managed transportation providers such as C.H. Robinson,\nTotal Quality Logistics, XPO Logistics, Echo Global Logistics, Coyote, Transfix, DHL, and NEXT Trucking.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe operate in a particularly complex legal and regulatory environment. Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules,\nand regulations, including those related to Internet activities, privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection,\npayments, labor and employment, transportation services, transportation network companies, licensing regulations and taxation. These laws and regulations are\nconstantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business. Examples of certain laws and regulations we\nare subject to are described below. For further discussion of risks relating to government regulation, see our risk factors, including the risk factors in the section\ntitled \u201cLegal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur platform, and in particular our Mobility products, are subject to differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws, rules, and regulations in the numerous\njurisdictions in which we operate. A large number of proposals are before various national, regional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within\nthe United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model.\nIn the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restrictions and other requirements on operating our Mobility products,\nincluding licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements. Outside of the United States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules,\nand regulations while other jurisdictions have not adopted any laws, rules, and regulations which govern our Mobility business. Further, certain jurisdictions,\nincluding Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, and\nregulations banning certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates\nsignificant complexities for our business and operating model. In addition, our Delivery and Freight products are also subject to laws, regulations and standards that\ngovern the transportation of food, alcohol and other goods.\nSubstantially all states in the United States and numerous municipalities in the United States and around the world have adopted Transportation Network\nCompany (\u201cTNC\u201d) regulations. These regulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or mobile apps that connect individual drivers with their own\nvehicles to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their destinations. These regulations often require TNCs to comply with rules regarding, among other things,\nbackground checks, vehicle inspections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters.\nIn addition, many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that apply to how we classify the Drivers who use our platform. For example, California\u2019s Assembly\nBill 5 (\u201cAB5\u201d), which went into effect in January 2020, codified a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The California Attorney\nGeneral, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint under AB5, alleging that drivers are misclassified,\nand sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. Although the Court\nissued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit, the parties were\ngranted a stipulation to dissolve the injunction in April 2021. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that\nprovides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and as a result of the passage\nof Proposition 22, Drivers are able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law, and we and our competitors are required to comply with\nthe provisions of Proposition 22.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5217, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "33c6fbfe-e5cf-4197-afd6-1ca784481452": {"__data__": {"id_": "33c6fbfe-e5cf-4197-afd6-1ca784481452", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c94f5297-d691-4cce-8fc4-7e34b1245f34", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "5a58a53b2eb27c0ac0e25e748e0efa069d32c35989d354ead27486e2e9e53732", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6ec115ed-7d9f-4d9a-97ca-1f9bfcee5d01", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "1a31d35452629021889b81e2a53a4be622ff30f3234f14a0657bf70277aabc20", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Although the Court\nissued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit, the parties were\ngranted a stipulation to dissolve the injunction in April 2021.

U.S. state, city, federal, and foreign regulators are expected\nto continue proposing and adopting significant laws impacting the processing of personal data and other data relating to individuals, such as the California Privacy\nRights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d) passed in California (effective in January 2023), and India\u2019s Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023.\nPayments and Financial Services\nMost jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. For example, our subsidiary in the Netherlands, Uber\nPayments B.V., is registered and authorized as an electronic money institution in support of certain payment activities in the European Economic Area (the \u201cEEA\u201d).\nRegulators in certain additional jurisdictions may determine that certain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtain licenses to\ncontinue to operate in such jurisdictions. In addition, laws related to money transmission and online payments are evolving, and changes in such laws could affect\nour ability to provide payment processing on our platform. We are continuing to evaluate our options for seeking further licenses and approvals in several other\njurisdictions to optimize payment solutions and support future growth of our business.\nAntitrust\nCompetition authorities closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of governments are enforcing\ncompetition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularly\nsurrounding issues of pricing parity, price-fixing, and abuse of market power. In addition, governmental agencies and regulators may, among other things, prohibit\nfuture acquisitions, divestitures, or combinations we plan to make, impose significant fines or penalties, require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other\nrestrictions that limit or require us to modify our operations, including limitations on our contractual relationships with platform users or restrictions on our pricing\nmodels.\nIntellectual Property\nWe believe that our intellectual property is essential to our business and affords us a competitive advantage in the markets in which we operate. Our intellectual\nproperty includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code, firmware, hardware and hardware designs, registered\nand unregistered trademarks, trademark applications, copyrights, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable), patents, and patent applications.\nTo protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual provisions, end-user policies,\nand disclosure restrictions. Upon discovery of potential infringement of our intellectual property, we assess and when necessary, take action to protect our rights as\nappropriate. We also enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to,\nand distribution of, our proprietary information in a commercially prudent manner.\nResearch and Development\nBecause the industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological advances, our ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon our\nability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive new offerings and technologies. We continue to develop new technologies to enhance existing offerings\nand services, and to expand the range of our offerings through research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d) and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.\nSeasonality\nMobility\nWe typically expect to experience seasonal impacts to our operating results as we generate higher Gross Bookings in our fourth quarter compared to other\nquarters due in part to fourth-quarter holiday and business demand, and typically generate lower Gross Bookings in our first quarter compared to other quarters due\nin part to less usage of our platform as holiday demand slows down. We have typically experienced softer quarter-over-quarter Mobility trends in the first quarter.\nDelivery\nWe typically expect to experience seasonal impacts to our operating results with increases in our Gross Bookings in the fourth quarter compared to other\nquarters, although the historical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations.\nHuman Capital at Uber\nEmployees\nWe are a global company and as of December 31, 2023, we and our subsidiaries had approximately 30,400 employees globally and operations in\napproximately 70 countries and more than 10,000 cities around the world.

The world of work has changed significantly in the last few years, and in response we have evolved our work philosophy\nto reflect all that we have learned and what we believe will produce the best results for our employees and our business going forward. Our work model has shifted\nto a hybrid model where employees have flexibility to work from home.\nEmployee Engagement. To attract and retain the best talent, we strive to establish a culture where people of all backgrounds can find a sense of belonging and\nare able to achieve their highest capability. We measure how successful we have been in establishing the culture we need through employee engagement surveys\nand related tools. We conduct continuous listening by collecting feedback from employees throughout the year and through various channels. We use the results of\nthese regular checks to better understand employees\u2019 needs and support their teams on topics such as well-being, inclusivity, fairness, rewards and recognition, and\ngrowth opportunities. For example, our hybrid return-to-office approach was shaped based on employee feedback. In addition to the engagement survey results, we\nalso monitor the health of our workforce and the success of our people operations through monitoring metrics such as attrition, retention, and offer acceptance\nrates, as well as sexual orientation, gender and ethnic diversity.\nEmployee Development and Retention. We believe that employees who have opportunities for development are more engaged, satisfied, and productive.\nEmployees are empowered to drive their own growth, whether by learning on the job, finding stretch assignments, participating in mentorship, or identifying their\nnext opportunity within Uber through internal mobility programs. Employees have access to an internal jobs marketplace for full-time jobs as well as short-term\nstretch assignments that enable them to have an impact on other areas of the business. Our goal is to help all employees be their best selves by providing programs\nand resources that promote wellness and productivity. This helps our diverse employee base manage life\u2019s expected and unexpected events. Globally, Uber offers\ncompetitive benefits packages to our employees and their families. We provide competitive benefits as well as offerings tailored to our unique populations.\nFor additional discussion, see the risk factor titled \u201c\u2014Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future\nattrition, or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business.\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as our\n2023 Environmental, Social, and Governance Report, which is available on our website.

We encourage\ndifferent opinions and approaches to be heard, and then we come together and build. We believe that when employees feel empowered to succeed in a work\nenvironment that celebrates, supports, and invests in diversity, progress follows. To achieve our objective to increase diversity in who we hire, we implement\nprocesses throughout Uber and measure progress. For example, the Mansfield Rule was implemented by June 2021, to ensure that we are considering female,\nLGBTQIA+ individuals, people with disabilities, and racially underrepresented talent by expanding the applicant pool for open roles.\nOur Board of Directors recognizes the strategic importance of these issues and incorporated diversity performance metrics into the compensation packages of\nour most senior executives.\nWe encourage employees who believe they, or any other employee, have been subjected to discrimination to notify their manager, Uber\u2019s People Team or the\nIntegrity Helpline.\nAs a company that powers movement, it is our goal to ensure that everyone can move freely and safely, whether physically, economically, or socially. To do\nthat, we strive to help fight racism that persists across society, be a champion for equity, and create opportunities for all, both inside and outside our company.\nFor more information regarding our Diversity and Inclusion efforts, please see our 2023 Environmental, Social, and Governance Report, which is available on\nour website.

We believe this flexibility is an improvement over traditional work schedules and is something we believe can\nand should remain available to anyone who chooses platform-based work. Uber monitors regional and global driver attraction, retention and satisfaction rates.\nAccessible, flexible, independent work has offered an option for many workers historically marginalized from the labor market and has enabled wide\ngeographic coverage and reliable service offerings for consumers. However, it is increasingly clear that more can be done to improve the experience of using an\napp to connect with work opportunities. Although the situation varies across countries and cities, the benefits and protections for independent workers are generally\npatchy compared with those that employees receive. The current binary system of employment classification under some legal frameworks means that a worker is\neither an employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few. This does not have to be the case. At\nUber, we believe that being your own boss should not have to come at the expense of security and dignity in work. Around the world, Uber has found innovative\nways to address these issues.\n\u2022Advocacy: We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent workers. We believe all work\nshould be treated equally. We also believe that legislative reform is needed to modernize the social safety net. This includes requiring Uber\u2014and other app\nbased companies\u2014to provide benefits and protections to their users without compromising the flexibility of their use of the app. Some examples of our\nadvocacy to preserve flexibility of work while expanding access to benefits and protections are as follows:\n\u25e6In Washington State, we welcomed a new law that preserves rideshare driver independence and confers new benefits such as minimum earnings\nguarantee, injury protection and paid sick leave.\n\u25e6 In Chile, the legislature passed a law that incorporates platform workers into the government\u2019s healthcare and pensions scheme and introduces\nnew requirements for platform companies such as minimum earnings guarantee for time spent actively working, maintain on-app insurance\ncoverage, and provide couriers with safety equipment.\n\u2022Protections and benefits: We partner with leading insurance companies around the world to pioneer protections for independent workers.\n\u2022Earnings: We are continually developing new technology that Drivers can use to acquire information that may help them save on costs and make\ninformed choices about where and when to drive (based on when and where their earnings potential is highest).\n\u2022Learning and Growth: We have partnered with learning and academic institutions to provide opportunities to eligible Drivers and their family members\nthrough undergraduate degree programs and courses on entrepreneurship, skills development and language learning. For example, since its launch in 2018,\nour partnership with Arizona State University has enrolled nearly 13,000 Drivers and their family members in undergraduate degree programs online.\n\u2022Engagement: We are focused on listening to and responding to the ideas and concerns of Drivers and Merchants who use our platform. We believe that\nthe best ideas can come from anywhere, both inside and outside our company. In locations around the world, we are piloting innovative ways for Drivers\nto participate in meaningful dialogue with us. In markets across the world, we hold regular meetings with Driver associations and conduct regular surveys\nto gather feedback on our app, our support services, and other matters.\nFor additional discussion, see the risk factor titled \u201c\u2014If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and\ncarriers, whether as a result of competition or other factors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users, and our financial results would be adversely\nimpacted.\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well our 2023 Environmental, Social, and Governance Report.

Any of the following risks could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\noperating results, or prospects and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, which would cause you to lose all or part of your investment. Our\nbusiness, financial condition, operating results, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not\nbelieve are material.\nRisk Factor Summary\nThe following are some of these risks, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition, operating results, or prospects.\n\u2022Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees instead of independent contractors.\n\u2022The mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades,\nlow barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region.\n\u2022To remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we have in the past offered,\nand may continue to offer, significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions.\n\u2022We have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses to increase\nin the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\n\u2022If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, whether as a result of competition or other\nfactors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users.\n\u2022Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning\ncould adversely affect our business.\n\u2022Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We receive significant media coverage, including negative\npublicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintain and\nenhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.\n\u2022Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges and our efforts to address these\nchallenges may not be successful.\n\u2022If we are unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth, our financial performance and future prospects will be\nadversely affected.\n\u2022Platform users may engage in, or be subject to, criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major safety incidents, which may\nharm our ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers.\n\u2022We are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future. These new ventures are\ninherently risky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them.\n\u2022We generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas, and these operations may be negatively affected by\neconomic, social, weather, and regulatory conditions, public health concerns or other circumstances.\n\u2022We may fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform, fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, or such\ntechnologies may fail to perform as expected, may be inferior to those offered by our competitors, or may be perceived as less safe than those offered by\ncompetitors or non-autonomous vehicles.\n\u2022We have experienced and may experience security or data privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, alteration of or destruction\nof our proprietary or confidential data, employee data, or platform user data.\n\u2022Cyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, denial of service attacks, spamming, and phishing attacks could harm our reputation,\nbusiness, and operating results.\n10", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4965, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dadd76e7-1a1c-45e7-9708-0606df604e96": {"__data__": {"id_": "dadd76e7-1a1c-45e7-9708-0606df604e96", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4fa8b23f-4f6f-40b6-98f5-27531fb27869", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "c1cf013c908c56670065697d7ddb5549b9791a05633ac5759882b3da286a8089", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\u2022Our growing use of artificial intelligence and machine learning may present additional risks, including risks associated with algorithm development or use,\nthe data sets used, and/or a complex, developing regulatory environment.\n\u2022We are subject to climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, our business may be adversely\nimpacted.\n\u2022Increased attention to, and evolving expectations regarding, environment, social and governance and sustainability matters may impact our business,\nreputation and liabilities, including in the context of certain commitments we have made.\n\u2022Occurrence of a catastrophic event, including but not limited to disease, a weather event, war, or terrorist attack, could adversely impact our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operation.\n\u2022We rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in certain of our products and\nofferings.

You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid and\nmay lose all or part of your investment.\nOperational and Economic Risks Related to Our Business\nOperational Risks\nOur business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees.\nThe classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We are\ninvolved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before\nadministrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as\nworkers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. We believe that Drivers are independent contractors because,\namong other things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors\u2019 platforms, and\nprovide a vehicle to perform services on our platform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions.\nFurthermore, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classification\nof Drivers have been and may continue to be material to our business.\nIn addition, more than 150,000 Drivers in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or expressed an intention to file)\narbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the classification claims of a majority of these Drivers under individual\nsettlement agreements. Furthermore, we are involved in numerous legal proceedings regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements entered into with\nDrivers. If we are not successful in such proceedings, this could negatively impact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which\ncould have an adverse consequence on our business and financial condition.\nChanges to foreign, state, and local laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial decisions regarding independent\ncontractor classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation of\nDrivers by labor unions.

Government authorities and private plaintiffs have brought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to\nbe classified as employees.\nIn November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like\nours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent\ncontractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation to\ndissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating\nto periods before the effective date of Proposition 22. Legal challenges, including constitutional challenges, to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to be\nfiled.\nWe face similar challenges in other jurisdictions within the United States and abroad. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a\ncomplaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that\nmay be brought in the future, we may be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a\nresult of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating\nDrivers, including expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements),\nemployee benefits, social security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders\nto offset these additional costs; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of other industry participants being\nsimilarly affected. Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment\nmodel, and we may not be able to hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally\nchange our business model, and consequently have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nOther examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that a driver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a\n\u201csubordinate relationship\u201d of the service, indicating an employment relationship, a decision by the French Supreme Court that reclassified an UberX Driver as an\nemployee (which has been followed by inconsistent appellate decisions regarding employee status), decisions by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that\nDrivers should be classified as employees for Swiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recent Spanish regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes\nemployment status and a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers are employees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining\nagreement.\nIn addition, reclassification of Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, have and could lead to groups of Drivers\nbecoming represented by labor unions and similar organizations. For example, in May 2021, we formally recognized a UK driver union. If a significant number of\nDrivers were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were to deviate significantly from our business model, our business, financial\ncondition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, a labor dispute involving Drivers may harm our reputation, disrupt\nour operations and reduce our net revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs.\nIn addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentation\nincluding revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled \u201cCritical\nAccounting Estimates\u201d included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 1 in the section titled \u201cNotes to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements\u201d included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades, low\nbarriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region.

Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of passenger miles in the\nmarkets that we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. In\naddition, public transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in\nmany cities. We also compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned entities, for Drivers and riders, including\nLyft, Ola, Didi, Grab, and Bolt.\n\u2022 Delivery. Our Delivery offering competes with numerous companies in the meal, grocery and other delivery space in various regions for Drivers,\nconsumers, and merchants, including DoorDash, Deliveroo, Glovo, Instacart, Gopuff, Rappi, iFood, Delivery Hero, Just Eat Takeaway, and Amazon.\nOur Delivery offering also competes with restaurants, including those that offer their own delivery and/or take-away, meal kit delivery services,\ngrocery delivery services, and traditional grocers.\n\u2022 Freight. Our Freight offering competes with global and North American freight brokers and managed transportation providers such as C.H.

A significant amount of our Delivery Gross\nBookings come from a limited number of large restaurant groups and other merchants, and this concentration increases the risk of fluctuations in our operating\nresults and our sensitivity to any material adverse developments experienced by our significant restaurant partners. If platform users choose to use other\nridesharing, meal delivery, or logistics services, we may lack sufficient opportunities for Drivers to earn a fare, Carriers to book a shipment, or restaurants to\nprovide a meal, which may reduce the perceived utility of our platform.

Further, we are investing in our\nautonomous vehicle strategy, which may add to Driver dissatisfaction over time, as it may reduce the need for Drivers. Driver dissatisfaction has in the past resulted\nin protests by Drivers in various regions, including India, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

Furthermore, we rely on a single background-check provider in certain jurisdictions, and we may not be able to\narrange for adequate background checks from a different provider on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The failure of this provider to provide background\nchecks on a timely basis would result in our inability to onboard new Drivers or retain existing Drivers undergoing periodic background checks that are required to\ncontinue using our platform.\nMaintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We receive significant media coverage, including negative publicity\nregarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintain or enhance our\nbrand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.\nMaintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our ability to attract new employees and platform users, to preserve and deepen the\nengagement of our existing employees and platform users, and to mitigate legislative or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, government investigations, and adverse\nplatform user sentiment.\nWe receive a high degree of negative media coverage around the world, which adversely affects our brand and reputation and fuels distrust of our company.\nNegative publicity, particularly related to the period prior to and through 2017, adversely affects our brand and reputation, makes it difficult for us to attract and\nretain platform users, reduces confidence in and use of our products and offerings, invites continued legislative and regulatory scrutiny, and results in additional\nlitigation and governmental investigations. As a result, our competitors raised additional capital, increased their investments in certain markets, and improved their\ncategory positions and market shares, and may continue to do so.\nWe recently released a second safety report, which provides the public with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other critical safety incidents claimed\nto have occurred on our platform in the United States. Public responses to our safety reports or any future safety reports or similar public reporting of safety\nincidents claimed to have occurred on our platform, which may include disclosure of reports provided to regulators and other government authorities, as well as\npublic responses to any third party assessments of our civil rights impact, may continue to result in positive and negative media coverage and increased regulatory\nscrutiny and could adversely affect our reputation with platform users. Further unfavorable media coverage and negative publicity could adversely impact our\nfinancial results and future prospects. As our platform continues to scale and becomes increasingly interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and\npublic awareness of our brand, future damage to our brand and reputation could have an amplified effect on our various platform offerings. Additionally, some of\nour acquired and majority-owned companies, including Careem, Postmates and Cornershop, have or will continue to use their own brands and/or operate their own\napps in parallel with our brand and apps, and any damage or reputational harm to their brands could adversely impact our brand and reputation.\nOur brand and reputation might also be harmed by events outside of our control. For example, we have licensed our brand in connection with certain\ndivestitures and joint ventures, including to Didi in China and to Yandex in Russia/CIS, and while we have certain contractual protections in place governing the\nuse of our brand by these companies, we do not control these businesses, we are not able to anticipate their actions, and consumers may not be aware that these\nservice providers are not controlled by us. Furthermore, if Drivers, merchants, or Carriers provide diminished quality of service, are involved in incidents regarding\nsafety or privacy, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise violate the law, we may receive unfavorable press coverage and our reputation and business may be harmed.\nAs a result, any of these third parties could take actions that result in harm to our brand, reputation, and consequently, our business.\nWhile we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will depend largely on maintaining a\ngood reputation, minimizing the number of safety incidents, continuing an improved culture and workplace practices, improving our compliance programs,\nmaintaining a high quality of service and ethical behavior, and continuing our marketing and public relations efforts. Our brand promotion, reputation building, and\nmedia strategies have involved significant costs and may not be successful. We anticipate that other competitors and potential competitors will expand their\nofferings, which will make maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand increasingly more difficult and expensive.

If we are\nunable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth or any future reductions in workforce, our financial performance and future\nprospects will be adversely affected.\nSince our inception, we have experienced rapid growth in the United States and internationally. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and\nhas placed, and will continue to place, significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and\ninternal financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage our growth effectively, which could damage our reputation and negatively affect\nour operating results.\nAs our operations have expanded, we have grown from 159 employees as of December 31, 2012 to approximately 30,400 global employees as of\nDecember 31, 2023, of whom approximately 17,500 were located outside the United States. The total number of our employees located outside the United States\nhas increased and may continue to increase as we expand globally. Properly managing our growth will require us to continue to hire, train, and manage qualified\nemployees and staff, including engineers, operations personnel, financial and accounting staff, and sales and marketing staff, and to improve and maintain our\ntechnology. If our new hires perform poorly, if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing, and integrating new employees and staff, or if we are not\nsuccessful in retaining our existing employees and staff, our business may be harmed. Moreover, in order to optimize our organizational structure, we have\nimplemented several reductions in workforce and restructurings, and may in the future implement other reductions in workforce. Any reduction in workforce or\nrestructuring may yield unintended consequences and costs, such as attrition beyond the intended reduction in workforce, the distraction of employees, or reduced\nemployee morale and could adversely affect our reputation as an employer, which could make it more difficult for us to hire new employees in the future and\nincrease the risk that we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the reduction in workforce. Properly managing our growth or any reductions in workforce\nwill require us to establish consistent policies across regions and functions, and a failure to do so could likewise harm our business.\nOur failure to upgrade our technology or network infrastructure effectively to support our growth could result in unanticipated system disruptions, slow\nresponse times, or poor experiences for Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers. To manage the growth of our operations and personnel and improve\nthe technology that supports our business operations, as well as our financial and management systems, disclosure controls and procedures, and internal controls\nover financial reporting, we will be required to commit substantial financial, operational, and technical resources. In particular, we will need to improve our\ntransaction processing and reporting, operational, and financial systems, procedures, and controls. For example, due to our significant growth, especially with\nrespect to our high-growth emerging offerings like Delivery and Freight, we face challenges in timely and appropriately designing controls in response to evolving\nrisks of material misstatement. These improvements are and will be particularly challenging when we acquire new businesses with different systems. Our current\nand planned personnel, systems, procedures, and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. If we are unable to expand our operations and hire\nadditional qualified personnel in an efficient manner, or if our operational technology is insufficient to reliably service Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, or\nCarriers, platform user satisfaction will be adversely affected and may cause platform users to switch to our competitors\u2019 platforms, which would adversely affect\nour business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur organizational structure is complex and will continue to grow as we add additional Drivers, consumers, merchants, Carriers, Shippers, employees,\nproducts and offerings, and technologies, and as we continue to expand globally.

Furthermore, if consumers engage\nin criminal activity or misconduct while using our platform, Drivers and merchants may be unwilling to continue using our platform. In addition, certain regions\nwhere we operate have high rates of violent crime, which has impacted Drivers and consumers in those regions. For example, in Latin America, there have been\nnumerous and increasing reports of Drivers and consumers being victimized by violent crime, such as armed robbery, violent assault, and rape, while taking or\nproviding a trip on our platform. If other criminal, inappropriate, or other negative incidents occur due to the conduct of platform users or third parties, our ability\nto attract platform users may be harmed, and our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nPublic reporting or disclosure of reported safety information, including information about safety incidents reportedly occurring on or related to our platform,\nwhether generated by us or third parties such as media or regulators, may adversely impact our business and financial results.\nFurther, we may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, deaths, injuries, or other incidents that are caused by Drivers, consumers,\nor third parties while using our platform, or even when Drivers, consumers, or third parties are not actively using our platform. On a smaller scale, we may face\nlitigation related to claims by Drivers for the actions of consumers or third parties. Furthermore, operating a motor vehicle is inherently dangerous. In addition, the\ngrowth of our Delivery offering has led to an increase in Couriers on two wheel vehicles such as scooters and bicycles, who are more vulnerable road users and\nface a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while driving in a vehicle. For example, urban hazards such as unpaved or uneven\nroadways increase the risk and severity of potential injuries. In addition, Couriers, in particular those on two wheel vehicles predominantly in metropolitan areas,\nneed to share, navigate, and at times contend with narrow and heavily congested roads occupied by cars, buses and light rail, especially during \u201crush\u201d hours, all of\nwhich heighten the potential risk of injuries or death. Our auto liability and general liability insurance policies may not cover all potential claims to which we are\nexposed, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability. These incidents may subject us to liability and negative publicity, which would increase our\noperating costs and adversely affect our business, operating results, and future prospects. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we will incur significant\ncosts in investigating and defending against them. As we expand our products and offerings, such as Freight, this insurance risk will grow.\nWe are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future. These new ventures are inherently\nrisky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them.\nWe have made substantial investments to develop new offerings and technologies, and we intend to continue investing significant resources in developing new\ntechnologies, tools, features, services, products and offerings. For example, through our acquisition of Cornershop, a provider of online grocery delivery in several\ncountries including Mexico and Chile, we expanded our Delivery offering to grocery delivery. Additionally, in October 2021, we acquired The Drizly Group, Inc.,\nwhich operates an on-demand alcohol marketplace in North America, in order to further expand our Delivery offering to alcohol. In November 2021, our subsidiary\nUber Freight acquired Transplace, expanding Uber Freight\u2019s business through Transplace\u2019s expertise in transportation management.

Our growth strategy has also included the divestment of certain lines of businesses in its entirety, and not just in certain\njurisdictions, and instead partnering and investing in our competitors in those lines of businesses. As a result, a significant portion of our assets includes minority\nownership positions, including in Didi, Grab, Lime, and Aurora.\nOur ownership in these entities involves significant risks that are outside our control. We are not represented on the management team or board of directors of\nDidi, and therefore we do not participate in its day-to-day management or the actions taken by the board of directors of Didi. We are not represented on the\nmanagement teams of Grab, Lime or Aurora, and therefore do not participate in the day-to-day management of Grab, Lime or Aurora. Although we are represented\non each of the boards of directors of Grab, Lime and Aurora, we do not have a controlling influence on those boards. As a result, the boards of directors or\nmanagement teams of these companies may make decisions or take actions with which we disagree or that may be harmful to the value of our ownership in these\ncompanies. Additionally, these companies have expanded their offerings, and we expect them to continue to expand their offerings in the future, to compete with us\nin various markets throughout the world.

Furthermore, the value of these\nassets is based in part on the market valuations of these entities, and weakened financial markets have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect\nsuch valuations. To the extent these businesses are or become publicly traded companies, volatility or fluctuations in the stock price of such companies could\nadversely impact our financial results. These positions could expose us to risks, litigation, and unknown liabilities because, among other things, these companies\nhave limited operating histories in evolving industries and may have less predictable operating results; to the extent these companies are privately owned, limited\npublic information is available and we may not learn all the material information regarding these businesses; are domiciled and operate in countries with particular\neconomic, tax, political, legal, safety, regulatory and public health risks, including the extent of the impact of the pandemic on their business; are domiciled or\noperate in countries that may become subject to economic sanctions or foreign investment restrictions; depend on the management talents and efforts of a small\ngroup of individuals, and, as a result, the death, disability, resignation, or termination of one or more of these individuals could have an adverse effect on the\nrelevant company\u2019s operations; and will likely require substantial additional capital to support their operations and expansion and to maintain their competitive\npositions.\nFurther, we are contractually limited in our ability to sell or transfer these assets. For example, in connection with Aurora\u2019s November 2021 initial public\noffering, we are subject to a 4-year lock-up with respect to our shares in Aurora. Furthermore, we may be required to sell these assets at a time at which we would\nnot be able to realize what we believe to be the long-term value of these assets. For example, if we were deemed an investment company under the Investment\nCompany Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d), we may be required to sell some or all of such assets so that we would not be subject to the\nrequirements of the Investment Company Act. Additionally, we may have to pay significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of these assets. Accordingly, we may\nnever realize the value of these assets relative to the contributions we made to these businesses.\nWe may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results.

In addition, circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our Delivery offering stemming\nfrom stay-at-home order demand related to the pandemic may not continue in the future. A softening of Driver, consumer, merchant, Shipper, or Carrier demand,\nwhether caused by changes in the preferences of such parties, failure to maintain our brand, changes in the U.S. or global economies, pandemics, licensing fees in\nvarious jurisdictions, competition, or other factors, may result in decreased revenue or growth and our financial results and future prospects would be adversely\nimpacted. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses, and if we cannot increase our revenue at a faster rate than the increase in our expenses, we will not\nachieve or maintain profitability.\nWe generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas and trips to and from airports.

Sustained declines in air travel have in the past, and may in the future, suppress demand for airport-related Mobility and\nreduce our Mobility Gross Bookings from airport trips. For example, during the height of the pandemic, travel behavior changed and airline travel slowed, reducing\nthe demand for Mobility to and from airports. Certain airports currently regulate ridesharing within airport boundaries, including by mandating that ridesharing\nservice providers obtain airport-specific licenses, and some airports, particularly those outside the United States, have banned ridesharing operations altogether.\nDespite such bans, some Drivers continue to provide Mobility services, including trips to and from airports, despite lacking the requisite permits. Such actions may\nresult in the imposition of fines or sanctions, including further bans on our ability to operate within airport boundaries, against us or Drivers. Additional bans on our\nairport operations, or any permitting requirements or instances of non-compliance by Drivers, would significantly disrupt our operations. In addition, if drop-offs or\npick-ups of riders become inconvenient because of airport rules or regulations, or more expensive because of airport-imposed fees, the number of Drivers or\nconsumers could decrease, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. While we have entered into agreements with most\nmajor U.S. airports as well as certain airports outside the United States to allow the use of our platform within airport boundaries, we cannot guarantee that we will\nbe able to renew such agreements on favorable terms if at all, and we may not be successful in negotiating similar agreements with airports in all jurisdictions.\nIf we fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform or fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, or if such\ntechnologies fail to perform as expected, are inferior to those offered by our competitors, or are perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-\nautonomous vehicles, our financial performance and prospects would be adversely impacted.\nWe have invested, and we may continue to invest, substantial amounts in companies with whom we partner to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our\nplatform. For example, in January 2021, we completed the merger of our autonomous technologies business with Aurora, and included a $400 million investment\nin the combined company and a commercial agreement pursuant to which we and Aurora will collaborate with respect to the launch and commercialization of self-\ndriving vehicles on our ridesharing network. We believe that autonomous vehicle technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact the industries in which\nwe compete and that autonomous vehicles present substantial opportunities. Several companies other than Aurora, including Waymo, Cruise Automation, Tesla,\nApple, Zoox (which Amazon has acquired), Aptiv, and Nuro, are developing autonomous vehicle technologies, either alone or through collaborations with car\nmanufacturers, and we expect that they will use such technology to further compete with us in the mobility, delivery, or logistics industries. Waymo has already\nintroduced a commercialized ridehailing fleet of autonomous vehicles, and it is possible that our competitors could introduce autonomous vehicle offerings earlier\nthan we will be able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform through our commercial agreement with Aurora or other partners. In the event that our\ncompetitors bring autonomous vehicles to market before we are able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, or their technology is or is perceived to be\nsuperior to the technology of parties with which we partner to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, they may be able to leverage such technology to compete\nmore effectively with us, which would adversely impact our financial performance and our prospects. For example, use of autonomous vehicles could substantially\nreduce the cost of providing ridesharing, delivery, or logistics services, which could allow competitors to offer such services at a substantially lower price as\ncompared to the price available to consumers on our platform. If a significant number of consumers choose to use our competitors\u2019 offerings over ours, our\nfinancial performance and prospects would be adversely impacted.\nAutonomous vehicle technologies involve significant risks and liabilities. Collisions, including fatal collisions, have happened. Failures of autonomous vehicle\ntechnologies that we may offer on our platform or crashes involving autonomous vehicles using the technology of our partners, could generate substantial liability\nfor us, create negative publicity about us, or result in regulatory scrutiny, all of which would have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, prospects,\nand operating results.\nFederal and state government regulations specifically designed to govern autonomous vehicle operation, testing and/or manufacture are developing.

In the context of our business, this includes market shifts toward electric vehicles (\u201cEVs\u201d) and lower carbon business models, and\npotential increased energy costs. Physical climate change risks include risks related to extreme weather events or natural disasters, and include extreme storms and\ntemperatures, flooding, droughts, freezes, wildfires, earthquakes and tsunamis, as well as chronic changes such as sea-level rise. Climate-related events, including\nthe increasing frequency, severity and duration of extreme weather events and their impact on critical infrastructure in the United States and elsewhere, have the\npotential to disrupt our business, our third-party suppliers, and the business of merchants, Shippers, Carriers and Drivers using our platform, and may cause us to\nexperience higher losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. While we and third parties may take various actions to mitigate business risks\nassociated with climate change, this may require incurring substantial costs and may not be successful, due to, among other things, the uncertainty associated with\nthe longer-term projections associated with managing climate risks. Additionally, we are or may become subject to emerging environmental and social laws and\nregulations, including climate policies such as regulations adopted in California in May 2021 requiring 90% of vehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in\nCalifornia to have been in zero emission vehicles by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. In addition, Drivers may be subject to climate-related policies\nthat indirectly impact our business, such as the Congestion Charge Zone and Ultra Low Emission Zone schemes adopted in London that impose fees on drivers in\nfossil-fueled vehicles, which may impact our ability to attract and maintain Drivers on our platform, and to the extent we experience Driver supply constraints in a\ngiven market, we may need to increase Driver incentives.\nMoreover, environmental and social laws and regulations, including climate regulations, are also increasing with a variety of stakeholders, including regulators\nseeking more information on related risks and impacts. For example, we are subject to regulation adopted in the European Union in December 2022, the Corporate\nSustainability Reporting Directive, with targets beginning in 2024. In the United States, we are subject to regulation and legislation at the state level, for example\nCalifornia recently adopted climate-related disclosure legislation and other states are expected to do so, and at the federal level by the US Securities and Exchange\nCommission. Additional regulation may require us to incur significant additional costs to comply, including the implementation of significant additional internal\ncontrols processes and procedures regarding matters that have not been subject to such levels of controls in the past, and impose increased oversight obligations on\nour management and board of directors, as well as require us to hire third party experts. Additional regulatory requirements may also end up exposing us to\nincreased activism, litigation and enforcement. All of these risks may also impact our suppliers, business partners or customers, which may impact our business,\nfinancial condition, or results of operations.\nIncreased attention to, and evolving expectations regarding, environment, social and governance and sustainability matters may impact our business,\nreputation and liabilities, including in the context of certain commitments we have made.\nWe have taken, and may continue to take, certain environmental and social actions, including the establishment of environmental and social goals or targets,\nincluding those that relate to climate change matters. Our ability to meet our environmental and social commitments is dependent on many external factors,\nincluding such factors as rapidly changing regulations, governmental or political shifts, policies and related interpretation, advances in technology such as battery\nstorage, as well the availability, cost and accessibility of EVs to Drivers, and the availability of EV charging infrastructure that can be efficiently accessed by\nDrivers.

To the extent we are subject to such activism, and we have been in the past, it may require us to incur costs\nor otherwise adversely impact our business. This and other stakeholder expectations will likely lead to increased compliance costs as well as scrutiny that could\nheighten all of the risks identified above and other similar risks.\nGeneral Economic Risks\nOccurrence of a catastrophic event, including but not limited to disease, a weather event, war, or terrorist attack, could adversely impact our business, financial\ncondition and results of operation.\nOutbreaks of contagious disease and the impact of actions to mitigate such disease or pandemic, have adversely impacted and could in the future adversely\nimpact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also face risks related to health epidemics, outbreaks of contagious disease, and other adverse\nhealth developments. For example, the pandemic and responses thereto had an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, for example, by reducing\nthe demand for our Mobility offerings globally, and affecting travel behavior and demand, as well as impacting Driver supply constraints. As another example,\nduring the pandemic, to support social distancing, we temporarily suspended our shared rides offering globally.\nThe extent of the impact of any future pandemic or outbreak of disease, on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments,\nincluding the duration of the spread of the outbreak and any future \u201cwaves\u201d or resurgences of the outbreak or variants of the virus, both globally and within the\nUnited States, the administration, adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, the impact on capital and financial markets, the impact\non global supply chains, foreign currencies exchange, governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business and whether the impacts may result in permanent\nchanges to our end-users\u2019 behaviors, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nIn addition, we cannot predict the impact any future pandemic or outbreak of a disease, or a catastrophic event will have on our business partners and third-\nparty vendors, and we may be adversely impacted as a result of the adverse impact our business partners and third-party vendors suffer. For example, concerns over\nthe economic impact of the pandemic caused extreme volatility in financial markets, which adversely impacted our stock price and our ability to access capital\nmarkets, and any future pandemics or other catastrophic events may have a similar impact. In addition, the broader consequences of the conflict between Russia\nand Ukraine, which may include additional international sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, and geopolitical shifts, increased tensions between the United\nStates and countries in which we operate, and the extent of the conflict\u2019s effect on the global economy, cannot be predicted. Any of these risks could materially\naffect the value of our assets, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or the trading price of our common stock.\nThe failure of a bank, or other adverse conditions impacting financial institutions at which we maintain balances, could adversely impact our liquidity and financial\nperformance. There can be no assurance that our deposits in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits will be backstopped by the U.S., or that any\nbank or financial institution with which we do business will be able to obtain needed liquidity from other banks, government institutions or by acquisition in the\nevent of a failure or liquidity crisis. To the extent any of the foregoing or other catastrophic event adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also\nhave the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the\npandemic that are not currently foreseeable, could adversely impact our business, financial performance and condition, and results of operations.\nThe impact of economic conditions, including the resulting effect on discretionary consumer spending, may harm our business and operating results.\nOur performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending. Some of the factors that have an impact on\ndiscretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgage\nmarkets, taxation, energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors.

The occurrence of an unanticipated problem, such as a\npower outage, telecommunications delay or failure, security breach, or computer virus could result in delays or interruptions to our products, offerings, and\nplatform, as well as business interruptions for us and platform users. Furthermore, foreign governments may leverage their ability to shut down directed services,\nand local governments may shut down our platform at the routing level. Any of these events could damage our reputation, significantly disrupt our operations, and\nsubject us to liability, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.

If these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us on\nacceptable terms or at all, our business may be disrupted. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we generally pay interchange fees and\nother processing and gateway fees, and such fees result in significant costs. In addition, online payment providers are under continued pressure to pay increased\nfees to banks to process funds, and there is no assurance that such online payment providers will not pass any increased costs on to merchant partners, including us.\nIf these fees increase over time, our operating costs will increase, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, system failures have at times prevented us from making payments to Drivers in accordance with our typical timelines and processes, and have\ncaused substantial Driver dissatisfaction and generated a significant number of Driver complaints.

If it is determined that we are not compliant with such rules, we could owe additional taxes.\nCertain jurisdictions, including Australia, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the UK and other countries, require that we pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed\nto contest or litigate the applicability of tax assessments in those jurisdictions. These amounts could materially adversely impact our liquidity while those matters\nare being litigated. This prepayment of contested taxes is referred to as \u201cpay-to-play.\u201d Payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject\nto such taxes; even when such payments are made, we continue to defend our positions vigorously. If we prevail in the proceedings for which a pay-to-play\npayment was made, the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest.\nAdditionally, the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate have in the past, and may in the future, examine or challenge our methodologies for\nvaluing developed technology, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and operating results. Furthermore, our future\nincome taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in\njurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, or changes in tax laws,\nregulations, or accounting principles.

Any adverse outcome of such reviews and audits could have an adverse effect on our financial\nposition and operating results. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by\nour management, and we have engaged in many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination remains uncertain. The ultimate tax outcome may differ from\nthe amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.

This legislation has\naccelerated the utilization of our net operating losses in the U.S., but it has not materially impacted our current tax obligations.\nIn August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (\u201cthe IRA\u201d) was enacted to take into effect for tax years after December 31, 2022.

Realization of these net operating loss\ncarryforwards depends on our future taxable income, and there is a risk that our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future\nincome tax liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.

Many U.S. states follow similar rules for restricting use of tax attributes after an ownership\nchange. We may experience ownership changes in the future because of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership.

As exchange rates vary, revenue, cost of revenue, exclusive of\ndepreciation and amortization, operating expenses, other income and expense, and assets and liabilities, when translated, may also vary materially and thus affect\nour overall financial results. We have not to date, but may in the future, enter into hedging arrangements to manage foreign currency translation, but such activity\nmay not completely eliminate fluctuations in our operating results due to currency exchange rate changes. Hedging arrangements are inherently risky, and we have\nlimited experience establishing hedging programs, which could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating\nresults.\nIf we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed, and any businesses we\nacquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, agreements to acquire companies, form joint ventures, divest\nportions or aspects of our business, sell minority stakes in portions or aspects of our business, and acquire complementary companies or technologies. Competition\nwithin our industry for acquisitions of businesses, technologies, and assets is intense. As such, even if we are able to identify a target for acquisition, we may not be\nable to complete the acquisition on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to receive approval from the applicable competition authorities, or such\ntarget may be acquired by another company, including one of our competitors.\nFurther, negotiations for potential acquisitions or other transactions may result in the diversion of our management\u2019s time and significant out-of-pocket costs.\nWe may expend significant cash or incur substantial debt to finance such acquisitions, and such indebtedness may restrict our business or require the use of\navailable cash to make interest and principal payments.

For example, in January\n2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could be\npicked up by ridesharing drivers; in March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via taxis only. In December 2018, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission\nimplemented a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services in\nNew York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform.

Our\ncontinuation of this practice and other past practices may result in fines or other penalties against us and Drivers imposed by local regulators, potentially increasing\nthe risk that our licenses or permits that are necessary to operate in such jurisdictions will not be renewed. Such fines and penalties have in the past been, and may\nin the future continue to be, imposed solely on Drivers, which may cause Drivers to stop providing services on our platform. In many instances, we make the\nbusiness decision as a gesture of goodwill to pay the fines on behalf of Drivers or to pay Drivers\u2019 defense costs, which, in the aggregate, can be in the millions of\ndollars. Furthermore, such business practices may also result in negative press coverage, which may discourage Drivers and consumers from using our platform\nand could adversely affect our revenue. In addition, we face regulatory obstacles, including those lobbied for by our competitors or from local governments\nglobally, that have favored and may continue to favor local or incumbent competitors, including obstacles for potential Drivers seeking to obtain required licenses\nor vehicle certifications. In addition, an increasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and\ncaps on surge pricing with respect to our Mobility offering. We have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant costs in defending our right to\noperate in accordance with our business model in many jurisdictions.

We are subject to differing, and sometimes\nconflicting, laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we provide our offerings. A large number of proposals are before various national, regional,\nand local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model.\nCertain proposals, if adopted, could significantly and materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results by restricting or limiting how we\noperate our business, increasing our operating costs, and decreasing our number of platform users. We cannot predict whether or when such proposals may be\nadopted.\nFurther, existing or new laws and regulations could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and\nregulations, and could dampen the growth and usage of our platform. For example, as we expand our offerings in new areas, such as non-emergency medical\ntransportation, we may be subject to additional healthcare-related federal and state laws and regulations. Additionally, because our offerings are frequently first-to-\nmarket in the jurisdictions in which we operate, several local jurisdictions have passed, and we expect additional jurisdictions to pass, laws and regulations that\nlimit or block our ability to offer our products to Drivers and consumers in those jurisdictions, thereby impeding overall use of our platform. We are actively\nchallenging some of these laws and regulations and are lobbying other jurisdictions to oppose similar restrictions on our business, especially our ridesharing\nservices.

We initiated some of these legal challenges to contest\nthe application of certain laws and regulations to our business.

For example, consumers using dockless e-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision\nthan that faced while riding in a vehicle, given the less sophisticated, and in some cases absent, passive protection systems on dockless e-bikes and e-scooters. The\noccurrence of real or perceived quality problems or material defects in current or future dockless e-bikes or e-scooters available via our app could result in negative\npublicity, market withdrawals, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if consumers are injured.\nChanges in, or failure to comply with, competition laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nCompetition authorities closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of governments are enforcing\ncompetition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularly\nsurrounding issues of pricing parity, earnings parity, price-fixing, and abuse of market power. Many of these jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to\nassert claims of anti-competitive conduct. For example, complaints have been filed in several jurisdictions, including in the United States and Germany, alleging\nthat our business practices violate applicable antitrust and/or competition laws. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new requirements or restrictions\non our business, other jurisdictions may follow. Further, any new requirements or restrictions, or proposed requirements or restrictions, could result in adverse\npublicity or fines, whether or not valid or subject to appeal.\nIn addition, governmental agencies and regulators may, among other things, prohibit future acquisitions, divestitures, or combinations we plan to make, impose\nsignificant fines or penalties, require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other restrictions that limit or require us to modify our operations, including\nlimitations on our contractual relationships with platform users or restrictions on our pricing models. Such rulings may alter the way in which we do business and,\ntherefore, may continue to increase our costs or liabilities or reduce demand for our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or\noperating results.\nWe expect that antitrust enforcement agencies (including the DOJ and the FTC) will continue to closely scrutinize merger activity, with a particular focus on\nthe technology sector, and there can be no assurance that proposed, completed or future mergers, acquisitions and divestitures will not be the subject of an\ninvestigation or enforcement action by the DOJ, the FTC or another antitrust enforcement agency. Changes in antitrust laws globally, or in their interpretation,\nadministration or enforcement, may limit our future acquisitions, divestitures, operations and growth.\nOur business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services.\nMost jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. Regulators in certain jurisdictions may determine that\ncertain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtain licenses to continue to operate in such jurisdictions. For example, our\nsubsidiary in the Netherlands, Uber Payments B.V., is registered and authorized by its competent authority, De Nederlandsche Bank, as an electronic money\ninstitution. This authorization permits Uber Payments B.V. to provide payment services (including acquiring and executing payment transactions and money\nremittances, as referred to in the Revised Payment Services Directive (2015/2366/EU)) and to issue electronic money in the Netherlands. In addition, Uber\nPayments B.V. has notified De Nederlandsche Bank that it will provide such services on a cross-border passport basis into other countries within the EEA.

A substantial increase in the frequency with which we make Driver payments without having received corresponding payments from consumers could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\nIn addition, laws related to money transmission and online payments are evolving, and changes in such laws could affect our ability to provide payment\nprocessing on our platform in the same form and on the same terms as we have historically, or at all.

The EU adopted the GDPR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements for\ncontrollers and processors of personal data. Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use of\npersonal data, strengthened individual data rights, data breach requirements, limitations on data retention, strengthened requirements for special categories of\npersonal data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, and additional obligations for contracting with service providers that may process personal data. In\naddition, the GDPR contains a provision that individuals shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including\nprofiling, which produces legal effects concerning them or similarly significantly affects them. Decisions by us based on AI or automated processing of data, or\ninsufficient disclosures regarding this processing, have and could impair our business and have and could subject us to lawsuits, regulatory investigations or other\nharm. The GDPR further provides that EU member states may institute additional laws and regulations impacting the processing of personal data, including (i)\nspecial categories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and\nautomated individual decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our\ncosts and harming our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to\nsignificant penalties, including fines of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data.\nOther jurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, including for automated processing,\ndecision making, and profiling, which will increase our compliance costs and the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the California Consumer\nPrivacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which provided new privacy rights for consumers and new operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The\nCCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of action against businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable\nsecurity procedures and practices to prevent data breaches.

Brazil provides another example, having passed the General\nData Protection Law (Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados Pessoais, or LGPD) in 2018, which is now in effect. These laws may be subject to amendments and\nregulations that may change over time, or result in additional follow-on laws such as the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d) passed in California in November\n2020. For further information on risks related to our use of automated decision making and automated processing, see the risk factor titled \u201c\u2014Our growing use of\nartificial intelligence and machine learning may present additional risks, including risks associated with algorithm development or use, the data sets used, and/or a\ncomplex, developing regulatory environment.\u201d\nAdditionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personal data\noutside the EEA. We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws. Such mechanisms have received heightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny and have\nundergone modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union had cast doubt on the adequacy of all of the formerly-approved\nmechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States. While in July 2023 the European\nCommission deemed a new EU-US Data Privacy Framework adequate for personal data transfers from the EU (and the rest of the EEA) to the US, this Framework\nhas been challenged. If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be\nunable to transfer personal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and\noperating results, and result in substantial fines, enforcement actions, litigation, injunctive relief, and other penalties that may be costly or that may impact our\nbusiness. In addition, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including from state and city regulators as a\nrequirement for obtaining or maintaining a license or otherwise, from law enforcement agencies, and from intelligence agencies. This disclosure or potential\ndisclosure may result in a failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, and regulations, could result in\nproceedings or actions against us in the same or other jurisdictions, and could have an adverse impact on our reputation and brand. In addition, Careem has\nhistorically shared certain user data with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We\nexpect to maintain our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem\u2019s business, and doing so may cause our relationship with\ngovernment authorities in certain jurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing fines or penalties against us. Further, if any\njurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or local computation such that we are unable to comply in a timely\nmanner or at all, we may risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. This could adversely affect the manner in which we provide our products and\nofferings and thus materially affect our operations and financial results.\nSuch data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation and enforcement, and thus\ncompliance requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent. This includes, for example, those relating to the processing of data for purposes of\nadvertising and profile creation, which are subject to evolving disclosure, choice, and consent requirements in the EU, US states, and other jurisdictions.\nCompliance with such laws may require changes to our data collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing and certain other related business practices\nand may thereby increase compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our operations. Additionally, any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy\nand data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, orders and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by individuals, consumer rights groups,\ngovernmental entities or agencies, or others. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if found liable, significant damages.\nFurther, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity.

In addition to insurance related to our products, we maintain other automobile\ninsurance coverage for owned vehicles and employee activity, as well as insurance coverage for non-automotive corporate risks including general liability, workers\u2019\ncompensation, property, cyber liability, and director and officers\u2019 liability. If our insurance carriers change the terms of our policies in a manner unfavorable to us or\nDrivers, our insurance costs could increase. The cost of insurance that we maintain on behalf of Drivers is higher in the United States and Canada than in other\ngeographies. Further, if the insurance coverage we maintain is not adequate to cover losses that occur, we could be liable for significant additional costs.\nIn addition, we and our captive insurance subsidiary are party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that transfer a significant portion of the\nrisk from the insurance provider to us or our captive insurance subsidiary, which could require us to pay out material amounts that may be in excess of our\ninsurance reserves, including as a result of adverse legal proceedings, resulting in harm to our financial condition. Our insurance reserves account for unpaid losses\nand loss adjustment expenses for risks retained by us through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms. Such amounts are based on\nactuarial estimates, historical claim information, and industry data. While management believes that these reserve amounts are adequate, the ultimate liability could\nbe in excess of our reserves. We also have requirements to post collateral for current and future claim settlement obligations with certain of our insurance carriers,\nwhich may have a significant impact on our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available for general business purposes.\nWe may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers who\nuse our platform, even when those Drivers are not actively using our platform or when an individual impersonates a Driver. As we expand to include more offerings\non our platform, our insurance needs will likely extend to those additional offerings, including Freight. As a result, our automobile liability and general liability\ninsurance policies and insurance maintained by Drivers may not cover all potential claims related to traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to\nhave been caused by Drivers who use our platform, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that we could face. Even if these claims do not result\nin liability, we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against them. If insurers become insolvent, they may not be able to pay otherwise valid\nclaims in a timely manner or at all. If we are subject to claims of liability relating to the acts of Drivers or others using our platform, we may be subject to negative\npublicity and incur additional expenses, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, we are subject to local laws, rules, and regulations relating to insurance coverage which could result in proceedings or actions against us by\ngovernmental entities or others. Legislation has been passed in many U.S. jurisdictions that codifies these insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing.\nAdditional legislation has been proposed in other jurisdictions that seeks to codify or change insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Further, service\nproviders and business customers of Freight and Uber for Business may require higher levels of coverage as a condition to entering into certain key contracts with\nus. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with local laws, rules, and regulations or contractual obligations relating to insurance coverage could result in\nproceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. These lawsuits, proceedings, or actions may subject us to significant penalties and negative\npublicity, require us to increase our insurance coverage, require us to amend our insurance policy disclosure, increase our costs, and disrupt our business.\nWe may be subject to pricing regulations, as well as related litigation or regulatory inquiries.\nOur revenue is dependent on the pricing models we use to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings. Our pricing models, including dynamic pricing, have\nbeen, and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in certain jurisdictions.

Often, their\nstock prices have fluctuated in ways unrelated or disproportionate to the companies\u2019 operating performance.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nWe are a party to various legal actions and government investigations, and similar or other actions could be brought against us in the future. The most\nsignificant of these matters are described below.\nLegal Proceedings Described in Note 14 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies to Our Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 14 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 contained in this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K includes information on legal proceedings that constitute material contingencies for financial reporting purposes that could have a material adverse\neffect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations if they were resolved in a manner that is adverse to us. This item should be read in\nconjunction with Note 14 for information regarding the following material legal proceedings, which information is incorporated into this item by reference:\n\u2022Driver Classification\n\u2022State Unemployment Taxes\nLegal Proceedings That Are Not Described in Note 14 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies to Our Consolidated Financial Statements\nIn addition to the matters that are identified in Note 14 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and incorporated into this item by reference, the following matters also constitute material\npending legal proceedings, other than ordinary course litigation incidental to our business, to which we are or any of our subsidiaries is a party.\nAustralia Class Actions\nIn May 2019, an Australian law firm filed a class action in the Supreme Court of Victoria, Australia, against us and certain of our subsidiaries, on behalf of\ncertain participants in the taxi, hire-car, and limousine industries. The plaintiff alleges that the Uber entities conspired to injure the group members during the\nperiod 2014 to 2017 by either directly breaching transport legislation or commissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Drivers in Australia. The\nclaim alleges, in effect, that these operations caused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value of\ncertain taxi licenses. In March, April and October 2020, the same Australian law firm filed four additional class action lawsuits alleging the same claim. We intend\nto continue to vigorously defend against the lawsuit. A trial has been scheduled to commence in March 2024.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nWhile it is not possible to determine the outcome of the legal actions, investigations, and proceedings brought against us, we believe that, except for the\nmatters described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could be\nmaterial to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period. We are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal\nproceedings, litigation, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related\nto the classification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with applicable law. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where\nwe may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Although the results of the legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations in\nwhich we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters is reasonably likely to have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. Regardless of final outcomes, however, any such legal proceedings, claims, and government\ninvestigations may nonetheless impose a significant burden on management and employees and may come with costly defense costs or unfavorable preliminary and\ninterim rulings.\nITEM 4.

Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. You should review the sections titled \u201cSpecial Note\nRegarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of forward-looking statements and in Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d, for a discussion of factors that\ncould cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and\nanalysis and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to power movement from point A\nto point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform. We connect consumers with providers of\nride services, merchants as well as delivery service providers for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Uber also connects consumers with public\ntransportation networks. We use this same network, technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to connect Shippers with Carriers in the freight\nindustry by providing Carriers with the ability to book a shipment, transportation management and other logistics services. We are also developing technologies\ndesigned to provide new solutions to solve everyday problems.\nDriver Classification Developments\nThe classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We are\ninvolved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before\nadministrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as\nworkers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5,\n2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco\nSuperior Court (the \u201cCourt\u201d) against Uber and Lyft, Inc., alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the\nalleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. To comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional\nexpenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earnings floor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care. We do\nnot expect these changes will have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\nIf, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, we\nwould incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including\nminimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential\npenalties. Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model,\nand we may not be able to hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform. Any of these events could negatively impact our business, result of\noperations, financial position, and cash flows.\nFor a discussion of risk factors related to how misclassification challenges may impact our business, result of operations, financial position and operating\ncondition and cash flows, see the risk factor titled \u201c-Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-\nemployees\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d, and Note 14 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Part\nII, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentation including revenue, cost of\nrevenue, incentives and promotions as further described in Note 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the\nconsolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d and the section titled \u201cCritical Accounting\nEstimates\u201d in Part II, Item 7, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n49", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4964, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8dfcef3c-6fdd-4a35-ac2f-d66bd6cd9863": {"__data__": {"id_": "8dfcef3c-6fdd-4a35-ac2f-d66bd6cd9863", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dddade17-7620-4910-83d4-5b0e8c0f1eb8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "06e48442d58a6b244984fbf0b0f52bf38c23e19bbcc1fc158bcfaf19f810d7c0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e8aabcad-fc80-452a-b0dc-c256ac552661", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9286bd5cb1e263ffca4428afe268e043d63a40f0b23112a9213f6d64888f25d2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Financial and Operational Highlights\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In millions, except per centages) 2022 2023 % Change% Change\n(Constant Currency )\nMonthly Active Platform Consumers (\u201cMAPCs\u201d) 131 150 15 %\nTrips 7,642 9,448 24 %\nGross Bookings $ 115,395 $ 137,865 19 % 20 %\nRevenue $ 31,877 $ 37,281 17 % 18 %\nIncome (loss) from operations $ (1,832)$ 1,110 **\nNet income (loss) attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. $ (9,141)$ 1,887 **\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 1,713 $ 4,052 137 %\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 642 $ 3,585 **\nFree cash flow $ 390 $ 3,362 **\n See the section titled \u201cReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for more information and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP\nfinancial measure.\n See the section titled \u201cCertain Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below for more information.\n MAPCs presented for annual periods are MAPCs for the fourth quarter of the year.\nNet cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow during the year ended December 31, 2022 reflected an approximately $733 million (\u00a3613\nmillion) cash outflow related to the resolution of all outstanding HMRC VAT claims that were paid during the fourth quarter of 2022.\nNet cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow during the year ended December 31, 2023 reflected an approximately $789 million (\u00a3631 million)\ncash outflow related to payments of HMRC VAT assessments for the period of March 2022 to June 2023.\nFor additional information on these matters, refer to Note 14 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II,\nItem 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as the section titled \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d.\n** Percentage not meaningful.\nHighlights for 2023\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, our MAPCs were 150 million, growing 8 million, or 6%, quarter-over-quarter, and growing 15% compared to the same period in\n2022.\nOverall Gross Bookings increased by $22.5 billion in 2023, up 19%, or 20% on a constant currency basis, compared to 2022.

Delivery Gross Bookings grew 15% year-over-year, on a constant\ncurrency basis, primarily driven by an increase in delivery orders and higher basket sizes. Freight Gross Bookings declined 25% year-over-year, on a constant\ncurrency basis, primarily attributable to lower revenue per load and volume both a consequence of the challenging freight market cycle.\nRevenue was $37.3 billion, up 17% year-over-year.

We act as an agent in these transactions by connecting consumers to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a Trip, meal, grocery or other delivery service.\nIn certain markets we are responsible for the Mobility or Delivery services (and in most markets we are responsible for the Freight services), and in these markets\nwe present revenue from end-users and from Shippers on a gross basis, with the payments to Drivers and Carriers classified within cost of revenue, exclusive of\ndepreciation and amortization.\nWe would expect revenue to fluctuate on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future based upon factors such as Trip volume, Driver supply,\nmacroeconomic conditions, global travel activities and management pricing and promotional activities. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we\nimplemented a business model change in certain major markets resulting in end-users becoming our customers.

Also included is the cost of customer\nsupport, Driver background checks and the allocation of certain corporate costs.\nWe would expect operations and support expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future as our business continues to grow and Trip\nvolume increases, but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we become more efficient in supporting platform users.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of advertising costs, product marketing costs, discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and credits\nprovided to end-users who are not customers, compensation costs, including stock-based compensation to sales and marketing employees, and the allocation of\ncertain corporate costs. We expense advertising and other promotional expenditures as incurred.\nWe would expect sales and marketing expenses to vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue due to timing of marketing campaigns.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we implemented a business model change in certain major markets resulting in end-users becoming our customers.\nPromotions to end-users considered customers are recognized as contra-revenue while promotions to end-users not considered customers are recognized as sales\nand marketing expenses.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees in engineering, design and\nproduct development.

We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our\nperformance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results.\nWe believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when\nplanning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management\u2019s internal comparisons to our historical\nperformance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key\nmetrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help\nthem analyze the health of our business. Accordingly, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in\nunderstanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors. Our calculation of these non-\nGAAP financial measures may differ from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures, if any, reported by our peer companies. These non-GAAP financial measures\nshould not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n60", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3396, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "808452c4-6f7b-4b67-bad8-0d40696b6892": {"__data__": {"id_": "808452c4-6f7b-4b67-bad8-0d40696b6892", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "63", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "868531cf-387d-4491-bee8-65993231a6aa", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "63", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "85adde4afd77f2a263d2a88bfece34046ff3206cf56329cbb7470441f98984fc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Adjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), excluding (i) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, (ii) net income (loss)\nattributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax, (iii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (iv) income (loss) from equity method investments, (v) interest\nexpense, (vi) other income (expense), net, (vii) depreciation and amortization, (viii) stock-based compensation expense, (ix) certain legal, tax, and regulatory\nreserve changes and settlements, (x) goodwill and asset impairments/loss on sale of assets, (xi) acquisition, financing and divestitures related expenses, (xii)\nrestructuring and related charges and (xiii) other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance.\nWe have included Adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key measure used by our management team to evaluate our operating\nperformance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions, including those relating to operating expenses. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted\nEBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team\nand board of directors. In addition, it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of certain non-cash\nexpenses and certain variable charges.\nLegal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements\nLegal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements are primarily related to certain significant legal proceedings or governmental investigations related\nto worker classification definitions, or tax agencies challenging our non-income tax positions. These matters have limited precedent, cover extended historical\nperiods and are unpredictable in both magnitude and timing, therefore are distinct from normal, recurring legal, tax and regulatory matters and related expenses\nincurred in our ongoing operating performance.\nLimitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature, and is not meant as a substitute for the related\nfinancial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These limitations include the following:\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain recurring, non-cash charges, such as depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets, and\nalthough these are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not\nreflect all cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring\nexpense in our business and an important part of our compensation strategy;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain restructuring and related charges, part of which may be settled in cash;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA excludes other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect period-to-period changes in taxes, income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay income taxes;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the components of other income (expense), net, which primarily includes: interest income; foreign currency exchange\ngains (losses), net; gain (loss) on business divestitures, net; unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, net; and impairment of debt and equity\nsecurities; and\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements that may reduce cash available to us.\n61", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3780, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a4f1f427-f25d-460a-ab6d-1b8895c38afb": {"__data__": {"id_": "a4f1f427-f25d-460a-ab6d-1b8895c38afb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc064414-edd8-47c2-b769-d484671a84fc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "17cd802d807936b12827e7bf2fa69954f15280adac74cda291648e7b33ecb56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc., the most directly comparable GAAP financial\nmeasure, to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In millions) 2022 2023\nAdjusted EBITDA reconciliation:\nNet income (loss) attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. $ (9,141)$ 1,887 \nAdd (deduct):\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax 3 269 \nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes (181) 213 \nIncome from equity method investments (107) (48)\nInterest expense 565 633 \nOther (income) expense, net 7,029 (1,844)\nDepreciation and amortization 947 823 \nStock-based compensation expense 1,793 1,935 \nLegal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements 732 9 \nGoodwill and asset impairments/loss on sale of assets, net 25 84 \nAcquisition, financing and divestitures related expenses 46 36 \nAccelerated lease costs related to cease-use of ROU assets 6 \u2014 \nCOVID-19 response initiatives 1 \u2014 \nLoss on lease arrangement, net 7 4 \nRestructuring and related charges 2 51 \nMass arbitration fees, net (14) \u2014 \nAdjusted EBITDA $ 1,713 $ 4,052 \nConstant Currency\nWe compare the percent change in our current period results from the corresponding prior period using constant currency disclosure.

These amounts\nare determined based on the non-cancelable quantities to which we are contractually obligated.\nIn November 2022, we entered into commercial technology agreements with vendors for cloud computing services (\u201c2022 Cloud Computing Service\nAgreements\u201d). We are committed to spend an aggregate of at least $2.7 billion through November 2029, of which $291 million is short-term. We may pay more\nthan the minimum purchase commitment to our cloud-computing web services providers based on usage. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, the\namounts utilized for these agreements were immaterial.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $3.0 billion in non-cancelable commitments, this includes the $2.7 billion in 2022 Cloud Computing Service Agreements\ndiscussed above. The non-cancellable commitments have varying expiration terms through November 2029.\nShare Repurchase Authorization\nIn February 2024, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $7.0 billion in shares of our outstanding common stock. The timing, manner, price\nand amount of any repurchases are determined by the discretion of management, depending on market conditions and other factors. Repurchases may be made\nthrough open market purchases and accelerated share repurchases. The exact number of shares to be repurchased by us, if any, is not guaranteed. Depending on\nmarket conditions and other factors, these repurchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or periodically without prior notice.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe believe that the following accounting policies involve a high degree of judgment and complexity and are critical to understanding and evaluating our\nconsolidated financial condition and results of our operations. An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires judgment on a significant accounting\nestimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have\nbeen used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,\nrevenue and expenses, and related disclosures in our audited consolidated financial statements. We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various\nother assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of\nassets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty\ninvolved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.\nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our\nconsolidated financial statements.

Our sole performance obligation in the transaction is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-users to\nfacilitate the completion of a successful ridesharing trip or delivery. In certain markets, we also generate revenue from end-users and charge a direct fee for use of\nthe platform or in exchange for Mobility or Delivery services.\nJudgment is required in evaluating the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and\nare the principal in the transaction (gross), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are the agent in the transaction (net). The\nassessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent in a transaction could impact the accounting for certain payments and incentives provided to\nDrivers and end-users and change the timing and amount of revenue recognized.\nDriver Incentives\nWe offer various incentive programs to Drivers. Judgment is required to determine the appropriate classification of these incentives. Incentives provided to\ncustomers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct service in exchange or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the service\nreceived. Incentives offered in exchange for specific services, such as referral services are recorded as sales and marketing expenses.\nEnd-User Discounts and Promotions\nWe offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not customers) to encourage use of our platform. Judgment is required to determine the appropriate\nclassification of these incentives. End-user discounts and promotions are recorded to sales and marketing expenses with the exception of market-wide promotions\nwhich are recorded as a reduction of revenue.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated\nfair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such\nvaluations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain\nintangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired advertiser, fleet, merchant, and end-user contracts, acquired technology,\nand trade names, based on expected future growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and royalty for similar brand licenses, useful\nlives, and discount rates.\nManagement's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a\nresult, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as\nacquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized.\nDuring the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed,\nwith the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nInvestments\u2014Non-Marketable Equity and Debt Securities\nWe hold investments in privately held companies in the form of equity securities and debt securities without readily determinable fair values and in which we\ndo not have a controlling interest or significant influence. Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are initially recorded at cost and\nare subsequently adjusted to fair value for impairments and price changes from observable transactions in the same or a similar security from the same issuer.\nInvestments in material available-for-sale debt securities are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date with\nthe changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We may elect the fair value option for financial instruments and account for\ninvestments in debt and equity securities at fair value with changes reported in net income (loss) from continuing operations.\nInvestments in privately held equity and debt securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in inactive markets. This valuation requires\njudgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. In determining the estimated\nfair value of our investments in privately held companies, we utilize the most recent data available including observed transactions such as equity financing\ntransactions of the investees and sales of the existing shares of the investees\u2019 securities. In addition, the determination of whether an observed transaction is similar\nto the equity and debt securities held by us requires significant management judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5434, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6e3826ed-ad26-40cc-b798-f87aa0449b18": {"__data__": {"id_": "6e3826ed-ad26-40cc-b798-f87aa0449b18", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ffc57dc4-4292-4881-8202-3952e2af5e9f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "0f0cd1d4c5c29bf9f972eb5192dd0391eff75180100694f4d06248939bd1ae1a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e637cba2-e6dd-4c53-8bf2-8150c486300f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "c42d1cbf0bd0531dedf457a25dd243fe2edd7d2036a3c1897261298c2ae10262", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We may elect the fair value option for financial instruments and account for\ninvestments in debt and equity securities at fair value with changes reported in net income (loss) from continuing operations.\nInvestments in privately held equity and debt securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in inactive markets.

In circumstances where we intend to sell, or\nare more likely than not required to sell the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the difference between the fair value and amortized cost is\nrecognized as a loss in the consolidated financial statement of operations, with a corresponding write-down of the security\u2019s amortized cost. In circumstances where\nneither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can\ninclude the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligor\u2019s, credit ratings actions, as\nwell as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare the present value of the expected cash flows of the\nsecurity discounted at the security\u2019s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security. A credit-related impairment is limited to the difference between\nfair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to net income\n(loss). Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Improvements in expected cash\nflows due to improvements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and corresponding reduction in the allowance for credit loss.\nEquity Method Investments\nWe account for investments in the common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence, but\nnot a controlling financial interest, using the equity method. Investments accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at cost. Subsequently, we\nrecognize through the consolidated statements of operations, and as an adjustment to the investment balance, our proportionate share of the investee entities\u2019 net\nincome or loss, and the amortization of basis differences. In accounting for these investments, we record our share of the entities\u2019 net income or loss one quarter in\narrears. Equity method investments for which the fair value option is elected are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value reflected in\nearnings.\nWe review our equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the\ninvestment may not be fully recoverable. Qualitative and quantitative factors considered as indicators of a potential impairment include financial results and\noperating trends of the investees, implied values in transactions of the investee\u2019s securities, severity and length of decline in value, and our intention for holding the\ninvestment, among other factors. If an impairment is determined to be other-than-temporary, the fair value of the impaired investment would have to be determined\nand an impairment charge recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the investment. The fair value determination, particularly for\ninvestments in privately held companies, requires significant judgment to determine appropriate estimates and assumptions. Changes in these estimates and\nassumptions could affect the calculation of the fair value of the investments and the determination of the impairment charges.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment\nWe review goodwill for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be\nimpaired. We make certain judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying\nvalues for each of our reporting units. Determination of reporting units is based on a judgmental evaluation of the level at which our segment managers review\nfinancial results, evaluate performance, and allocate resources.\nJudgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include, among other factors: financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political,\nbusiness, and other factors; entity specific factors; industry and market considerations, macroeconomic conditions, and other relevant events and factors affecting\nthe reporting unit. To the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test\nis then performed.\nPerforming a quantitative goodwill impairment test includes the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and involves significant estimates and\nassumptions. These estimates and assumptions include, among others, revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows,\nrisk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and the determination of appropriate market comparables.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, indirect tax examinations, or government inquiries and investigations that may arise in the\nordinary course of business.

Therefore, if one or more of these matters were\nresolved against us for amounts in excess of management\u2019s expectations, our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, including in a particular\nreporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. The\nestablishment of deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers of intangible assets requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine\nthe fair value of such intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue and\nexpense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and/or discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expected\nfuture cash flows to present value are derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow.\nAlthough we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, internal and\nexternal comparable data and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such\nassumptions, estimates or actual results.\nWe account for uncertainty in tax positions by recognizing a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be\nsustained upon examination. Evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes are inherently uncertain and require making\njudgments, assumptions, and estimates. While we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax\noutcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. To the extent\nthat the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact the provision for income taxes and the effective tax\nrate in the period in which such determination is made.\nThe provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition,\nwe are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly\nassess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\nBased on available evidence, management believes it is not more-likely-than-not that the net U.S., Netherlands, and other non-material jurisdictions\u2019 deferred\ntax assets will be fully realizable. In these jurisdictions, we have recorded a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. We regularly review the deferred\ntax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, the\nexpected timing of the reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies by jurisdiction. Our judgment regarding future profitability\nmay change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and/or tax planning strategies.\nBased on our assessment of current income and anticipated future earnings, there is a reasonable possibility that we will have sufficient evidence to release a\nsignificant portion of the valuation allowance in the U.S. within the next 12 months.

Actual results depend upon the outcome of future contingent events and can be affected by many factors, such\nas claim settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal, and social environments. As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the\nliability, and when these amounts will be paid, may vary in the near term from the estimated amounts.\nWhile management believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8,\n\u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency\nrisk as follows:\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2030 Refinanced Term Loans. The 2030 Refinanced Term Loans represent\nfloating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact our consolidated financial statements. The interest rate for\nthe 2030 Refinanced Term Loans is SOFR plus 2.75% per annum, subject to a floor of 0.00%. There is no cap on the interest rate associated with the 2030\nRefinanced Term Loans. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on the 2030 Refinanced Term Loans. A hypothetical 100 basis\npoint increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\nThe fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining\nin periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $231 million\nas of December 31, 2023.\nInvestment Risk\nOur investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution or commercial issuer. Cash deposits typically exceed insured\nlimits and are placed with financial institutions around the world that we believe are of high credit quality. These deposits are in excess of the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) insurance limits. There can be no assurance that our deposits in excess of the FDIC limits will be backstopped by the U.S., or that\nany bank or financial institution with which we do business will be able to obtain needed liquidity from other banks, government institutions or by acquisition in\nthe event of a failure or liquidity crisis.\nOur investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. We had cash and cash\nequivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $6.7 billion and $7.0 billion as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nMarketable debt securities classified as restricted investments and short-term investments totaled $5.5 billion as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023,\nour cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government securities, U.S. government\nagency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate\nsecurities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A\nhypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\nWe are exposed to certain risks related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held entities and\npublic companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to value given\nthe lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk. These\ninvestments in privately-held entities and public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes in the fair value of\nthese investments. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time\nafter a public offering.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4819, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "83ebb778-dd69-4338-8cfc-80746dc872c9": {"__data__": {"id_": "83ebb778-dd69-4338-8cfc-80746dc872c9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "70", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c77e559c-1ce6-4745-8dec-7524ac2dfa17", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "70", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "650dd8819693a0a6e66afb8d52036396e3e17dea8a812504822ffae225214bbb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f531dba6-45ac-4496-b35e-0d629b919b5b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "70", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "f8b6acaf700a311fe44186aa2b46b919b623824c6544f95d13cea7575ed24404", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments.

Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB)\nand are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant\nestimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial\nreporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and\nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical\naudit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nPresentation of Mobility and Delivery Revenue Agreements, Including Incentives, Discounts and Promotions to Drivers, Merchants and End-Users\nAs described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company derives its revenues from Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 use of the Company\u2019s\nplatform, on-demand lead generation, and related services in connection with Mobility and Delivery services, as well as from direct fees charged to end-users for\nuse of the platform or in exchange for Mobility or Delivery services. Management applies judgment in determining whether the Company is the principal or agent\nin transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users. This determination impacts the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis as well as the presentation of\nincentives provided to Drivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users, to the extent they are not customers. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company\u2019s Mobility and Delivery revenue, net of incentives, was $32.0 billion and discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and\ncredits provided to end-users who are not customers totaled $1.7 billion, of which a significant portion relates to discounts and promotions.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the presentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue agreements, including\nincentives, discounts and promotions to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in assessing the\npresentation of revenue on a gross or net basis, as well as the presentation of incentives, discounts and promotions offered to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users,\nwhich in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to whether\ntransaction attributes were appropriately analyzed and presented by management.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial\nstatements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company\u2019s revenue recognition process, including controls over the\npresentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue, incentives, discounts and promotions. These procedures also included, among others, testing, on a sample basis, trip\ntransaction attributes and assessing management\u2019s classification of new or changed agreements by examining documentation related to the agreement terms, driver\nstatements, rider receipts, and discount, promotion and incentive terms, and assessing the impact of those terms and attributes on the presentation of revenue and\nincome statement classification.\nValuation of Insurance Reserves\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents\nthe estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for certain risks retained by the Company, including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical\ndamage, general liability, and workers\u2019 compensation, and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not\nreported as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and\nloss experience. In addition, management uses assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs,\nwhich consider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data. These reserves are continually reviewed by management and adjusted as experience\ndevelops and new information becomes known. The Company\u2019s short-term and long-term insurance reserves as of December 31, 2023 totaled $6.7 billion.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves is a critical audit matter are the\nsignificant judgment by management when developing the estimate of the insurance reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity\nand effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the actuarial methods and management\u2019s significant assumptions related to loss\ndevelopment patterns and expected loss costs. The audit effort also involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial\nstatements.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5489, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b2b2d49c-de94-424e-98d5-3c2d1c798eb2": {"__data__": {"id_": "b2b2d49c-de94-424e-98d5-3c2d1c798eb2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6947583a-6cf9-458c-9b40-b1c0c4c29c78", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "a368da4f2ac4c18bd647626654e62746c5c3aa254fda0172e806299cf5ce398f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ca32c69a-adca-4193-86ce-8914380b0a09", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "d8b9c39689c25a287415e8f32bc4074abe35961937b6313e934172e40efaefce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "These reserves are continually reviewed by management and adjusted as experience\ndevelops and new information becomes known.

Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\nUber Technologies, Inc. (\u201cUber,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is a\ntechnology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B.\nUber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d). Uber connects\nconsumers (\u201cRider(s)\u201d) with independent providers of ride services (\u201cMobility Driver(s)\u201d) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other consumers\n(\u201cEaters\u201d) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, \u201cMerchants\u201d) with delivery service providers (\u201cCouriers\u201d) for meal preparation, grocery and\nother delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \u201cend-user(s)\u201d or \u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to\nas \u201cDriver(s).\u201d Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and product\nexpertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry. Uber is also developing technologies designed to provide new solutions to solve everyday\nproblems.\nOur technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe (excluding Russia), the Middle East,\nAfrica, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia).\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States\n(\u201cGAAP\u201d). We consolidate our wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control, and variable interest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d)\nwhere we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Refer to Note 15 \u2013 Variable Interest Entities for further information. All intercompany balances and\ntransactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which affect the\nreported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions which\nmanagement believes are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: fair values of\ninvestments and other financial instruments (including the measurement of credit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value of\nacquired intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment of goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves;\ncertain deferred tax assets and tax liabilities; insurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual\nresults could differ from those estimates.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nCash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, restricted investments, other receivables, and accounts receivable are\npotentially subject to credit risk concentration. Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits,\nU.S. government and agency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one\nfinancial institution or commercial issuer. Cash deposits typically exceed insured limits and are placed with financial institutions around the world that we believe\nare of high credit quality. We have not experienced any material losses related to these concentrations during the periods presented. Our other receivables include\nfunds withheld by well-established insurance companies with high credit quality that may be used to cover future settlement of reserved insurance claims. We rely\non a limited number of third parties to provide payment processing services (\u201cpayment service providers\u201d) to collect amounts due from end-users. Payment service\nproviders are financial institutions or credit card companies that we believe are of high credit quality. No customers accounted for 10% or more of revenue for the\nyears ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash held in checking and savings accounts as well as investments in money market funds, U.S. government and agency\nsecurities, commercial paper, corporate bonds, and time deposits. We consider all highly-liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of\nthree months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash includes amounts collected on behalf of, but not yet remitted to Drivers and Merchants,\nwhich are included in accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5174, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6cf1bc54-dfd5-4e05-bbe1-d07c847ef08f": {"__data__": {"id_": "6cf1bc54-dfd5-4e05-bbe1-d07c847ef08f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a2bb9423-196e-45c1-a992-0d938130242b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "6812462f8deadb8737c5aea1c43b2f613851e4f2270cd697b019b813263ad20c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8a5166e6-1d7a-488c-abe0-e5d0e8527771", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "b08641eac822bfe6038656505ed59289b1ff822a6110a83fe77c758f9c2fbe5f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We rely\non a limited number of third parties to provide payment processing services (\u201cpayment service providers\u201d) to collect amounts due from end-users.

These funds, previously held in a trust account, were\nwithdrawn by James River during the fourth quarter of 2019 upon notice of cancellation of their insurance policies (primarily auto insurance policies) issued to one\nof our subsidiaries. The funds served as collateral for us and our subsidiary\u2019s current and future claim settlement obligations under the indemnification agreements\nfor these insurance policies as included in insurance reserves on the consolidated balance sheet. Accordingly, the amount withdrawn was presented as collateral\nheld by insurer on the consolidated balance sheet.\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, in connection with the legacy auto insurance transfer as described below, James River returned funds, previously presented as\ncollateral held by insurer, to the trust account where the funds were previously held. Accordingly, the funds were reclassified from collateral held by insurer to non-\ncurrent restricted cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021.\nLegacy Auto Insurance Transfer\nOn September 27, 2021, Aleka Insurance, Inc., our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, entered into a Loss Portfolio Transfer Reinsurance Agreement\n(the \u201cLPTA\u201d) with James River effective July 1, 2021. Pursuant to the LPTA, our captive insurance subsidiary reinsured certain automobile liability insurance risks\nrelating to activity on our platform between 2013 and 2019 in exchange for payment by James River to our captive insurance subsidiary of a premium in the\namount of $345 million (\u201cPremium\u201d). Subsequent to the LPTA, we retain substantially all of the liabilities on these policies when taken together with previous risk\ntransfer arrangements. In connection with the LPTA, claims administered by James River were transferred to a third-party claims administrator for ongoing\nhandling (the \u201cTransferred Claims\u201d) at our expense. The liabilities associated with the Transferred Claims were re-evaluated as of September 30, 2021, and adverse\ndevelopment was recognized on certain of those liabilities. During the third quarter of 2021, we recognized a $103 million charge in our consolidated statement of\noperations consisting of the difference between the Premium and the assumed liabilities (including the cost of future claims administration), expenses associated\nwith the LPTA, and the adverse development on the Transferred Claims.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable represents: (i) uncollected payments from end-users for completed transactions where the payment method is credit card and includes (a)\nend-user payments not yet settled with payment service providers and (b) end-user payments settled by payment service providers but not yet remitted to us; (ii)\ncompleted shipments where we have an unconditional right to the consideration from Freight customers (\u201cShippers\u201d) and payment has not been received; or (iii)\nuncollected payments from Uber for Business organizations for completed transactions. The timing of settlement of amounts due from these parties varies by\nregion and by product. The portion of the receivable to be remitted to Drivers and Merchants is included in accrued and other current liabilities. Refer to Note 9 \u2013\nSupplemental Financial Statement Information for amounts payable to Drivers and Merchants.\nAlthough we pre-authorize forms of payment to mitigate our exposure, we bear the cost of any accounts receivable losses. We record an allowance for doubtful\naccounts for accounts receivable that may never settle or be collected, as well as for credit card chargebacks including fraudulent credit card transactions. The\nallowance for doubtful accounts is primarily included as cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. We estimate the allowance based on historical\nexperience, estimated future payments and geographical trends, which are reviewed periodically and as needed, and amounts are written off when determined to be\nuncollectible. Chargebacks and credit card losses were $246 million, $286 million and $245 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023,\nrespectively.\n83", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4695, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4b970e37-4e4a-4c9a-a735-03c102899f4f": {"__data__": {"id_": "4b970e37-4e4a-4c9a-a735-03c102899f4f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "86", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a79adc98-df2d-4f97-815f-d70175b86f02", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "86", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "5e3ebfde085cbcab68edf29e17e19ad3077cfdf5e5b0cd242e98e51ed083fc07", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6d33652c-d329-4303-80f1-91f891714cca", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2b6395e5661f9e334371ffb17b407d8348ae73bb1ab9fa406fceec67f7a1b142", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Property and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight\u2011line\nmethod over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are as follows:\nProperty and Equipment Estimated Useful Life\nLand Indefinite\nBuildings 30-45 years\nSite improvements 5-15 years\nComputer equipment 3-5 years\nFurniture and fixtures 3-5 years\nInternal-use software 2 years\nLeased computer equipment Shorter of estimated useful life or lease term\nLeasehold improvements Shorter of estimated useful life or lease term\nWhen assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost, accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or\nloss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations in the period realized. Maintenance and repairs that do not enhance or extend the asset\u2019s useful life are\ncharged to operating expenses as incurred.\nWe capitalize certain costs, such as compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, and interest incurred on outstanding debt, in developing internal-\nuse software once planning has been completed, management has authorized and committed project funding, and it is probable that the project will be completed\nand the software will function as intended. Amortization of such costs occurs on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset and begins\nonce the asset is ready for its intended use. Costs incurred prior to meeting these criteria, together with costs incurred for training and maintenance, are expensed as\nincurred. In addition, we capitalize interest incurred on outstanding debt during the period of construction-in-progress of certain assets.\nLeases\nWe account for leases in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 842, \u201cLeases\u201d (\u201cASC 842\u201d). We elected the \u201cpackage of practical\nexpedients,\u201d which permits us not to reassess under ASC 842 our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. We made a\npolicy election not to separate non-lease components from lease components, therefore, we account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease\ncomponent. We also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify.\nWe determine if a contract contains a lease at inception of the arrangement based on whether we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic\nbenefits from the use of an identified asset and whether we have the right to direct the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration, which relates to an\nasset which we do not own. Right of use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our\nobligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets are recognized as the lease liability, adjusted for lease incentives received. Lease liabilities\nare recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future\nlease payments is our incremental borrowing rate (\u201cIBR\u201d), because the interest rate implicit in most of our leases is not readily determinable. The IBR is a\nhypothetical rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be to borrow and resulting interest we would pay to borrow an amount equal to the\nlease payments in a similar economic environment over the lease term on a collateralized basis. Lease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixed\npayments or in-substance fixed payments are included in our lease liability calculation. Variable lease payments may include costs such as common area\nmaintenance, utilities, real estate taxes or other costs. Variable lease payments are recognized in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for those\npayments are incurred.\nOperating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated\nbalance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued and other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated\nbalance sheets. For operating leases, lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis in operations over the lease term.

Refer to Note 17 \u2013 Business Combinations for further information.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is allocated to reporting units\nexpected to benefit from the business combination. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. We evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassign\ngoodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. In testing for goodwill impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of\nevents or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after\nassessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount,\nthen additional impairment testing is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, we proceed to the quantitative assessment.\nThe quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its book value, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds book value,\ngoodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. However, if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment\nloss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Refer to Note 7 \u2013 Goodwill and\nIntangible Assets for further information.\nIntangible Assets, Net\nIntangible assets are carried at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from two to 18 years. We review\ndefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment under the long-lived asset model described in the Evaluation of Long-Lived Assets for Impairment section. Refer to\nNote 7 \u2013 Goodwill and Intangible Assets for further information.\nInvestments\nEquity Securities\nAccounting for our equity securities varies depending on the marketability of the security and the type of investment. Our marketable equity securities in\npublicly traded companies are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. Certain investments\nin non-marketable equity securities are measured at cost, with remeasurements to fair value only upon the occurrence of observable price changes in orderly\ntransactions for the identical or similar securities of the same issuer, or in the event of any impairment. We reassess non-marketable equity securities at each\nreporting period to determine whether they have a readily determinable fair value, in which case they would no longer be eligible for fair value measurement\nalternative. Non-marketable equity securities that we elected to apply the fair value option and equity securities with a readily determinable fair value are measured\nat fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. We evaluate our non-marketable equity\nsecurities for impairment at each reporting period based on a qualitative assessment that considers various potential impairment indicators. Impairment indicators\nmight include, but would not necessarily be limited to, a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, or business prospects of\nthe investee, a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, a bona fide offer to purchase, an offer by the\ninvestee to sell, or a completed auction process for the same or similar securities for an amount less than the carrying amount of the investments in those securities.\nIf an impairment exists, a loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the\ninvestment. We include investments in equity securities within investments on the consolidated balance sheets.\nDebt Securities\nAccounting for our debt securities varies depending on the legal form of the security, our intended holding period for the security, and the nature of the\ntransaction.

In\ncircumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factors considered in determining whether a\ncredit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, credit\nratings actions, as well as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare the present value of the expected cash\nflows of the security discounted at the security\u2019s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security. A credit-related impairment is limited to the\ndifference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment\nto net income (loss). Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Improvements in\nexpected cash flows due to improvements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and corresponding reduction in the allowance for credit loss.\nRestricted Investments\nAs of December 31, 2023, restricted investments on the consolidated balance sheets are comprised of marketable debt securities that may include U.S.\ngovernment and agency securities, commercial paper, corporate bonds, and time deposits, which are held in trust accounts at third-party financial institutions\npursuant to certain contracts with insurance providers. Restricted investments are classified as non-current assets as these investments are unavailable for use in\nshort-term operations due to legal and/or contractual restrictions.\nEquity Method Investments\nInvestments in common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence, but not a controlling\nfinancial interest, over the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, unless the fair value option is elected. Investments accounted for\nunder the equity method are initially recorded at cost. Subsequently, we recognize through the consolidated statements of operations and as an adjustment to the\ninvestment balance, our proportionate share of the investees\u2019 net income or loss and the amortization of basis differences. We record our share of the results of\nequity method investments one quarter in arrears as income (loss) from equity method investment, net of tax in the consolidated statements of operations.

Evidence of a loss in value might include, but would not necessarily be limited to, absence of an ability to recover the\ncarrying amount of the investment or inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment. This\nevaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors including recent financial results and operating trends of the investee; implied values in recent\ntransactions of investee securities; other publicly available information that may affect the value of our investments.\nEvaluation of Long-Lived Assets for Impairment\nWe evaluate our held-and-used long-lived assets for indicators of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount\nof an asset or asset group (collectively, the \u201casset group\u201d) may not be recoverable. We measure the recoverability of the asset group by comparing the carrying\namount of such asset groups to the future undiscounted cash flows it expects the asset group to generate.

These evaluations are complex,\ninvolve judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information, among other factors. If we determine that an\nentity for which we hold a contractual or ownership interest in is a VIE and that we are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate such entity in the consolidated\nfinancial statements. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that meets both of the following criteria: (1) has the power to make decisions that most\nsignificantly affect the economic performance of the VIE; and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could\npotentially be significant to the VIE. Periodically, we determine whether any changes in the interest or relationship with the entity impact the determination of\nwhether the entity is still a VIE and whether we are still the primary beneficiary. If we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the\ninvestment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP. Refer to Note 15 \u2013 Variable Interest Entities for further information.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when or as we satisfy our obligations. We derive revenue from Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 use of our platform, on-demand lead generation,\nand related services, including facilitating payments from end-users. The service enables Drivers and Merchants to seek, receive and fulfill on-demand requests\nfrom end-users seeking Mobility or Delivery services (collectively the \u201cUber Service\u201d). In certain markets we also generate revenue from end-users. In these\nmarkets, we charge end-users a direct fee for use of the platform or in exchange for Mobility or Delivery services. Additionally, we derive revenue from customers'\nuse of Freight services.\nWe periodically reassess our revenue recognition policies as business models and other factors evolve.\nMobility and Delivery Agreements\nWe primarily enter into Master Services Agreements (\u201cMSA\u201d) with Drivers and Merchants to use the platform. The MSA defines the service fee we charge\nDrivers and Merchants for each transaction. Upon acceptance of a transaction, Drivers and Merchants agree to perform the services as requested by an end-user.\nThe acceptance of a transaction request combined with the MSA establishes enforceable rights and obligations for each transaction. A contract exists between us\nand the Drivers and Merchants after the Drivers and Merchants accept a transaction request and the Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 ability to cancel the transaction lapses.\nThe Uber Service activities are performed to satisfy our sole performance obligation in the transaction, which is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-\nusers to facilitate the completion of a successful transaction.\nIn markets where we are responsible for Mobility services to end-users, end-users are our customers and our sole performance obligation in the transaction is\nto provide transportation services to the end-user. In markets where we are responsible for Delivery services to end-users, Merchants and end-users are our\ncustomers. In addition to our performance obligation to Merchants, our performance obligation to end-users is to provide delivery services.\nIn certain markets, we charge Mobility and Delivery end-users a fee to use the platform. In these transactions, in addition to performance obligations to Drivers\nand Merchants, we have a performance obligation to end-users to connect end-users to Drivers and Merchants in the marketplace.\nPrincipal vs. Agent Considerations\nJudgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users. We evaluate the presentation\nof revenue on a gross or net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and are the principal (i.e. \u201cgross\u201d), or we arrange for other\nparties to provide the service to the end-user and are an agent (i.e. \u201cnet\u201d). This determination also impacts the presentation of incentives provided to Drivers and\nMerchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users to the extent they are not customers.\nIn Mobility and Delivery transactions where our role is to provide the Uber Service to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a successful trip or Delivery service,\nwe do not control and are not primarily responsible for the good or service provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5144, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "41d59dca-7e1b-4f72-94a8-e8f786ee57a3": {"__data__": {"id_": "41d59dca-7e1b-4f72-94a8-e8f786ee57a3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "89", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "432374e1-2019-4b4e-be90-a67fb506f23f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "89", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "748276db5288d64da70e65a143ea7c5b5aa7bc11e8e48b9ec1dc4ae173207aaf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "26a1ad4a-8b83-494b-b15d-2aba405666f1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "89", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "9fd9406184fb262f842741898794ec90d632626e4df4be993e0689df3146b619", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Principal vs. Agent Considerations\nJudgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users.

In markets where we earn the difference between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned by\nDrivers, end-users are quoted a fixed upfront price for ridesharing services while we pay Drivers based on actual time and distance for the ridesharing services\nprovided.

Costs\nincurred with carriers for Brokerage are recorded in cost of revenue. Shippers contract with us to utilize our network of independent freight carriers to transport\nfreight. We enter into contracts with Shippers that define the price for each shipment and payment terms. Our acceptance of the shipment request establishes\nenforceable rights and obligations for each contract. By accepting the Shipper's order, we have responsibility for transportation of the shipment from origin to\ndestination. We enter into separate contracts with independent freight carriers and are responsible for payment of freight charges to the carrier regardless of\npayment by the Shipper. We invoice the Shipper upon satisfaction of our sole performance obligation to transport a Shipper\u2019s freight using our network of\nindependent freight carriers.

Revenue is presented on a gross basis in the\namount billed to Merchants and brands as we control the advertisement before it is transferred to the end-user.\nIncentives to Customers\nIncentives provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service or cannot reasonably estimate the fair\nvalue of the good or service received. Incentives to customers that are not provided in exchange for a distinct good or service are evaluated as variable\nconsideration, in the most likely amount to be earned by the customer at the time or as they are earned by customers, depending on the type of incentive. Since\nincentives are earned over a short period of time, there is limited uncertainty when estimating variable consideration.\nIncentives earned by customers for referring new customers are paid in exchange for a distinct service and are accounted for as customer acquisition costs. We\nexpense such referral payments as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We expense costs to acquire new\ncustomer contracts as incurred because the amortization period would be one year or less. The amount recorded as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the\nincentive paid or the established fair value of the service received.

In these transactions, the resulting\nshortfall amount is recorded as a reduction of revenue.\nEnd-User Discounts and Promotions\nWe offer discounts and promotions to end-users to encourage use of our platform. These are offered in various forms of discounts and promotions and include:\nTargeted end-user discounts and promotions: These discounts and promotions are offered to a limited number of end-users in a market to acquire, re-engage,\nor generally increase end-users use of the Platform, and are akin to a coupon. An example is an offer providing a discount on a limited number of rides or deliveries\nduring a limited time period. We record the cost of these discounts and promotions to end-users who are not our customers as sales and marketing expenses at the\ntime they are redeemed by the end-user.\nEnd-user referrals: These referrals are earned when an existing end-user (the referring end-user) refers a new end-user (the referred end-user) to the platform\nand the new end-user who is not our customer completes their first transaction on the platform. These referrals are typically paid in the form of a credit given to the\nreferring end-user. These referrals are offered to attract new end-users to the Platform. We record the liability for these referrals and corresponding expenses as\nsales and marketing expenses at the time the referral is earned by the referring end-user.\nMarket-wide promotions: These promotions are pricing actions in the form of discounts that reduce the end-user fare charged by Drivers and Merchants to\nend-users who are not our customers for all or substantially all Mobility or Delivery offerings in a specific market. This also includes any discounts offered under\nour subscription offerings and certain discounts within the Uber Rewards programs, which enable end-users to receive a fixed fare or a discount on all eligible\nrides. Accordingly, we record the cost of these promotions as a reduction of revenue at the time the transaction is completed.\nRefunds and Credits\nRefunds and credits to end-users due to end-user dissatisfaction with the Platform are recorded as sales and marketing expenses or as a reduction of revenue\ndepending on whether the end-user is considered a customer based on the market. Refunds to end-users that we recover from Drivers and Merchants are recorded\nas a reduction of revenue.\nOther\nWe have elected to exclude from revenue, taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and are concurrent with specific revenue\nproducing transactions, and collected from Drivers, Merchants and end-users and remitted to governmental authorities.

We estimate the volatility of common stock on the date of grant\nbased on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility of our own shares or comparable publicly traded companies in our industry group. The risk-free\ninterest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with a term equal to the expected term. We estimate the expected term based on\nthe simplified method for employee stock options considered to be \u201cplain vanilla\u201d options, as our historical share option exercise experience does not provide a\nreasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term.

The service-based condition for these awards generally is satisfied over three or four years.\nThe performance-based conditions generally are satisfied upon achieving specified performance targets, such as our financial or operating metrics, and/or the\noccurrence of a qualifying event, defined as the earlier of (i) the closing of certain specific liquidation or change in control transactions, or (ii) an initial public\noffering (\u201cIPO\u201d). We record stock-based compensation expense for performance-based equity awards such as RSAs, RSUs, SARs, and stock options on an\naccelerated attribution method over the requisite service period, which is generally three or four years, and only if performance-based conditions are considered\nprobable to be satisfied.\nFor performance-based awards and RSUs, we determine the grant-date fair value to be the fair value of our common stock on the grant date.\nFor performance-based SARs, stock options, and warrants, we determine the grant-date fair value utilizing the valuation model as described above for service-\nbased awards.\nMarket-Based Awards\nWe have granted RSUs and stock options that vest only upon the satisfaction of the following conditions: service-based conditions, performance-based\nconditions, and/or market-based conditions. The service-based condition for these awards generally is satisfied over three or four years. The performance-based\nconditions generally are satisfied upon achieving specified performance targets, such as the occurrence of a qualifying event, as described above for performance-\nbased awards. The market-based conditions are satisfied upon our achievement of specified fully-diluted equity values, as determined based on our stock price.\nFor market-based awards, we determine the grant-date fair value utilizing a Monte Carlo valuation model, which incorporates various assumptions including\nexpected stock price volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rates, expected date of a qualifying event, and expected capital raise percentage. We estimate the\nvolatility of common stock on the date of grant based on historical volatility of Uber\u2019s stock price. We estimate the expected term based on various exercise\nscenarios. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\nWe record stock-based compensation expense for market-based equity awards such as RSUs and stock options on an accelerated attribution method over the\nrequisite service period, and only if performance-based conditions are considered probable to be satisfied. We determine the requisite service period by comparing\nthe derived service period to achieve the market-based condition and the explicit service-based period, using the longer of the two service periods as the requisite\nservice period.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201cESPP\u201d)\nWe recognize stock-based expenses related to shares issued pursuant to our 2019 ESPP on a straight-line basis over the offering period.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5191, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "00d29041-9137-4b6e-aee0-1b4f92838f68": {"__data__": {"id_": "00d29041-9137-4b6e-aee0-1b4f92838f68", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "92", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e4fc47e-66f0-4125-b8b0-717cba02778b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "92", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "ae9f9ef2a89bc880dd9239ba1f9bc65741da8f85c86960a71d8ad67b73bfc135", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5c734d9f-efdc-46a3-a936-837a50634511", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "92", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "c826f1ee2305f2dccfbec6dc14893e9722fc7dd59ea87434d7b5e947187230ec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We estimate the\nvolatility of common stock on the date of grant based on historical volatility of Uber\u2019s stock price.

We estimate the expected term based on the contractual term.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future\ntax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe account for uncertainty in tax positions recognized in the consolidated financial statements by recognizing a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position\nwhen it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on\nthe technical merits. Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized.\nWe recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for (benefit from) income taxes in the consolidated statements\nof operations.\nValuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more-likely-than-not expected to be realized based\non the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the\nappropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. We\nregularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, excess tax benefits related to stock-\nbased compensation, the expected timing of the reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment regarding future\nprofitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and/or tax planning\nstrategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the\nassessment is changed. We elected the tax law ordering approach in assessing the realizability of net operating losses expected to offset future Global Intangible\nLow-taxed Income (\u201cGILTI\u201d).\nWe have elected to treat any potential GILTI inclusions as a period cost.\nThe establishment of deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers of intangible assets requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to\ndetermine the fair value of such intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue\nand expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and/or discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expected\nfuture cash flows to present value are derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow.\nAlthough we believe the assumptions and estimates utilized are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, internal and external\ncomparable data and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such\nassumptions, estimates or actual results.\nExpenses\nSet forth below is a brief description of the components of our expenses:\n\u2022Cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily consists of costs incurred for certain Mobility and Delivery transactions where we\nare primarily responsible for Mobility and Delivery services and pay Drivers and Couriers for services, certain insurance costs related to our Mobility and\nDelivery offerings, costs incurred with Carriers for Uber Freight transportation services, credit card processing fees, bank fees, data center and networking\nexpenses, mobile device and service costs, and amounts related to fare chargebacks and other credit card losses.\n\u2022Operations and support expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees that support operations in\ncities, including the general managers, Driver operations, platform user support representatives and community managers. Also included is the cost of\ncustomer support, Driver background checks and the allocation of certain corporate costs.\n\u2022Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of advertising costs, product marketing costs, discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and\ncredits provided to end-users who are not customers, compensation costs, including stock-based compensation to sales and marketing employees, and the\nallocation of certain corporate costs. We expense advertising and other promotional expenditures as incurred. Advertising expenses totaled $1.7 billion for\neach of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023.

We record a liability for employee termination\nbenefits either when it is probable that an employee is entitled to them and the amount of the benefits can be reasonably estimated or when management has\ncommunicated the termination plan to employees and all of the following conditions have been met: management, having the authority to approve the action,\ncommits to a plan of termination; the plan identifies the number of employees to be terminated, their job classifications and their locations, and the expected\ncompletion date; the plan establishes the terms of the benefit arrangement in sufficient detail to enable employees to determine the type and amount of benefits they\nwill receive if they are involuntarily terminated; and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be\nmade or that the plan will be withdrawn. We accrue for costs to terminate contracts other than a lease when we terminate the contract in accordance with the\ncontract terms. Costs that will continue to be incurred for the remaining term of a contract that is not a lease, and provide no economic benefits to us are recognized\nat the cease-use date. Costs associated with lease contracts are accounted for under the leasing accounting guidance or under the long-lived assets accounting\nguidance.\nRestructuring and related charges are recognized as an operating expense within the consolidated statements of operations and are classified based on our\nclassification policy for each category of operating expense. Personnel costs are classified based on each employee\u2019s classification, lease costs (including\nimpairments of right-of-use assets) are classified in the same expense line item where each lease\u2019s rent expense was recognized and impairment of other long-lived\nassets are recorded within general and administrative expenses.\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency or U.S. dollar depending on the nature of the subsidiaries\u2019 activities. Monetary assets\nand liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured to the functional currency at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the\nperiod. Gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are recorded in foreign exchange gains (losses), net within other income (expense), net in the consolidated\nstatements of operations. Subsidiary assets and liabilities with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are translated at the month-end rate, retained earnings and other\nequity items are translated at historical rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year. Cumulative translation\nadjustments are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of total equity (deficit).\nNet Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nWe compute net income (loss) per share using the two-class method required for participating securities. The two-class method requires income available to\ncommon stockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if\nall income for the period had been distributed.\nOur restricted common stock, and common stock issued upon early exercise of stock options are participating securities. We consider restricted common stock\nand any shares issued upon early exercise of stock options, subject to repurchase, to be participating securities because holders of such shares have non-forfeitable\ndividend rights in the event a cash dividend is declared on common stock.\nInsurance Reserves\nWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, to provide for the\npotential liabilities for certain risks, including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, general liability, and workers\u2019\ncompensation.

Reserve amounts estimated to be settled within one year are recorded in short-term insurance reserves, with longer term\nsettlements recorded in long-term insurance reserves on the consolidated balance sheets.\nWhile management believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided. All\nestimates of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserves, are subject to inherent variability caused by the nature of the\ninsurance claim settlement process. Such variability is increased for us due to limited historical experience and the nature of the coverage provided. Actual results\ndepend upon the outcome of future contingent events and can be affected by many factors, such as claims settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal,\nand social environments. As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability and when these amounts will be paid may vary from the\nestimate provided on the consolidated balance sheets.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, indirect tax examinations or government inquiries and investigations that may arise in the\nordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we\nbelieve that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the\nloss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the consolidated financial statements.\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and\nrelated reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of\nnegotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and the\nestimated amount of loss.\nThe outcomes of litigation, indirect tax examinations and investigations are inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved\nagainst us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, including in a particular reporting\nperiod in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.\nWe recognize estimated losses from contingencies that relate to proceedings in which Drivers are the plaintiffs, or proceedings and regulatory penalties against\nDrivers for which we elect to either pay on behalf of or reimburse Drivers, as a reduction of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.

Level 2 instrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments, identical instruments in less\nactive markets, or models using market observable inputs. Level 3 instrument valuations are valued based on unobservable inputs and other estimation techniques\ndue to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such financial instruments.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2023, our Level 3 non-marketable equity securities and note receivable from a related party primarily consist of common stock\ninvestments and convertible secured notes that may be converted into common or preferred stock in privately held companies without readily determinable fair\nvalues.\nDepending on the investee\u2019s financing activity in a reporting period, management\u2019s estimate of fair value may be primarily derived from the investee\u2019s\nfinancing transactions, such as the issuance of preferred stock to new investors. The price in these transactions generally provides the best indication of the\nenterprise value of the investee. Additionally, based on the timing, volume, and other characteristics of the transaction, we may supplement this information by\nusing other valuation techniques, including the guideline public company approach. The guideline public company approach relies on publicly available market\ndata of comparable companies and uses comparative valuation multiples of the investee\u2019s revenue (actual and forecasted), and therefore, unobservable input used in\nthis valuation technique primarily consists of short-term revenue projections.\nOnce the fair value of the investee is estimated, an option-pricing model (\u201cOPM\u201d), a common stock equivalent (\u201cCSE\u201d) method or a hybrid approach is\nemployed to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us.

Other unobservable inputs, including short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, and\nvolatility are less sensitive to the valuation in the respective reporting(2) \n(3) \n(1)\n(1) \n96", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3184, "end_char_idx": 4604, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "09f4ad88-a5f7-4985-a86c-d41dc6b57b12": {"__data__": {"id_": "09f4ad88-a5f7-4985-a86c-d41dc6b57b12", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "99", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c8f3b798-8853-4c4b-b032-9d7e366ebdaa", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "99", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "9c27562e1b8d6a946b8fc634063377057b2356ce53a168bd6d70546f29f57a50", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "06314584-d264-4427-ad6e-87110ee1f8a3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4e56c2ea76a370a368a2c7deea478b6f411079c3934ee3ee9af7dfaa62ac28aa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "periods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee\u2019s financing transactions.

Upon closing of the transaction in December 2023, e&\nacquired a majority stake in Careem Technologies and we retained a minority ownership interest. Careem Technologies is considered a related party to us upon the\nclosing of the transaction. We continue to fully own the ridesharing business of Careem.\nUpon closing of the transaction, we recognized a gain of approximately $204 million during the fourth quarter of 2023, in other income (expense), net on our\nconsolidated statement of operations. Additionally, we received two seats on Careem Technologies\u2019 board and retained an approximately 42% equity ownership\ninterest consisting of common stock in Careem Technologies. The initial fair value of our equity method investment in Careem Technologies is $300 million. The\ninvestment was determined to be an equity method investment due to our ability to exercise significant influence over Careem Technologies.\nIncluded in the initial carrying value of $300 million was a preliminary estimated basis difference related to the difference between the cost of the investment\nand our proportionate share of the net assets of Careem Technologies. As of December 31, 2023, this basis difference was not material. The carrying value of the\nequity method investment will be primarily adjusted for our share in the income or losses of Careem Technologies on a one-quarter lag basis and amortization of\nbasis differences.\nWe amortize the basis difference related to the intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the assets that gave rise to the difference using the straight-\nline method.

As of December 31, 2022, our equity ownership interest in MLU\nB.V. was 29% on a fully-diluted basis.\nWe review for impairment whenever factors indicate that the carrying value of the equity method investment may not be recoverable. During the first quarter\nof 2022, we determined that our investment in MLU B.V. was other-than-temporarily impaired, and recorded an impairment charge of $182 million in other income\n(expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations. The impairment was primarily due to consensus projections of a protracted recession of the Russian\neconomy as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. To determine the fair value of our investment in MLU B.V., we utilized a market approach referencing revenue\nmultiples from publicly traded peer companies.\n2021\nOn August 30, 2021, we entered into an agreement with Yandex (the \u201cFramework Agreement\u201d) to restructure our joint ventures, MLU B.V. and Yandex Self\nDriving Group B.V.

By entering\ninto the Capped Calls, we expect to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock (or, in the event a conversion of the 2028 Convertible Notes is settled in\ncash, to reduce our cash payment obligation) in the event that at the time of conversion of the 2028 Convertible Notes the trading price of our common stock price\nexceeds the conversion price of the 2028 Convertible Notes.\nThe initial cap price of the Capped Calls was approximately $95.81 per share, which represents a premium of 75% over the last reported sale price of our\ncommon stock of $54.75 on the New York Stock Exchange on November 20, 2023, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Calls.

The difference of $243 million between the principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes and the liability\ncomponent (the \u201cdebt discount\u201d) was amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2025 Convertible Notes.

These intercompany transfers did not have a material impact to the financial statements.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we transferred certain intangible assets among our wholly-owned subsidiaries to align our structure to our evolving\noperations.

In these jurisdictions, we have recorded a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. We regularly review the deferred\ntax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, the\nexpected timing of the reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies by jurisdiction. Our judgment regarding future profitability\nmay change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and/or tax planning strategies.

operating segments based on how the CODM manages the business, allocates resources, makes operating decisions and evaluates operating\nperformance.\nIn January 2021, we sold our ATG Business to Aurora. Our ATG Business was included in the ATG and Other Technology Programs segment prior to this\ntransaction. As a result of the sale, ATG and Other Technology Programs segment was no longer a reportable segment. Beginning in the first quarter of 2021,\nresults of ATG and Other Technology Programs are included within All Other. Refer to Note 18 \u2013 Divestitures for further information regarding the sale of our ATG\nBusiness.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our three operating and reportable segments are as follows:\nSegmentDescription\nMobility Mobility products connect consumers with Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws,\nmotorbikes, minibuses, or taxis. Mobility also includes activity related to our financial partnerships products and advertising.\nDelivery Delivery offerings allow consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or\nhave the meal delivered. In certain markets, Delivery provides offerings for grocery, alcohol, and convenience store delivery as well\nas select other goods. We refer to the grocery, alcohol, convenience and retail categories collectively as Grocery & Retail. Delivery\nalso includes advertising.\nFreight Freight connects Carriers with Shippers on our platform, and gives Carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a\nshipment. Freight also includes transportation management and other logistics services offerings.\nFor information about how our reportable segments derive revenue, as well as revenue grouped by offerings and geographical region, refer to Note 2 \u2013\nRevenue.\nOur segment operating performance measure is segment Adjusted EBITDA. The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset information and,\naccordingly, we do not report asset information by segment. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is defined as revenue less the following expenses: cost of revenue,\noperations and support, sales and marketing, and general and administrative and research and development expenses associated with our segments. Segment\nAdjusted EBITDA also excludes non-cash items or items that management does not believe are reflective of our ongoing core operations (as shown in the table\nbelow).\n120", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2510, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "622df70f-baa9-47d1-80e8-0a32714703de": {"__data__": {"id_": "622df70f-baa9-47d1-80e8-0a32714703de", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "123", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9da1bd3c-7a23-4d27-bf17-6a78ac67d76e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "123", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "e6d09a1e5d12ec8ab6f76b6553c9bcb83ee62b367608d505537d62afde5be471", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The following table provides information about our segments and a reconciliation of total segment Adjusted EBITDA to loss from operations (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021 2022 2023\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA:\nMobility $ 1,596 $ 3,299 $ 4,963 \nDelivery (348) 551 1,506 \nFreight (130) \u2014 (64)\nAll Other (11) \u2014 \u2014 \nTotal Segment Adjusted EBITDA 1,107 3,850 6,405 \nReconciling items:\nCorporate G&A and Platform R&D (1,881) (2,137) (2,353)\nDepreciation and amortization (902) (947) (823)\nStock-based compensation expense (1,168) (1,793) (1,935)\nLegal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements (526) (732) (9)\nGoodwill and asset impairments/loss on sale of assets (157) (25) (84)\nAcquisition, financing and divestitures related expenses (102) (46) (36)\nAccelerated lease costs related to cease-use of ROU assets (5) (6) \u2014 \nCOVID-19 response initiatives (54) (1) \u2014 \nLoss on lease arrangement, net \u2014 (7) (4)\nRestructuring and related charges \u2014 (2) (51)\nLegacy auto insurance transfer (103) \u2014 \u2014 \nMass arbitration fees, net (43) 14 \u2014 \nIncome (loss) from operations $ (3,834)$ (1,832)$ 1,110 \nIncludes historical results of ATG and Other Technology Programs and New Mobility.\n Includes costs that are not directly attributable to our reportable segments.

In connection with the enactment of California\nState Assembly Bill 5 (\u201cAB5\u201d), we have received and expect to continue to receive - in California and in other jurisdictions - an increased number of\nmisclassification claims.

The test is referred to as the\n\u201cABC\u201d test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018. Under the ABC test, workers\nperforming services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the hiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring entity\u2019s\ncontrol, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work or type of\nbusiness performed for the hiring entity.\nOn May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in\nSan Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc. (\u201cLyft\u201d). The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified, and seeks an injunction and monetary damages\nrelated to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order, prohibiting us from classifying drivers as independent contractors and from violating\nvarious wage and hour laws.

On April 12, 2021, the California Attorney General, Uber and Lyft filed a stipulation to dissolve the preliminary injunction with\nthe trial court. On April 16, 2021, the trial court signed an order granting the stipulation. Although the preliminary injunction has been dissolved, the lawsuit\nremains ongoing relating to claims by the California Attorney General for periods prior to enactment of Proposition 22. The parties petitioned to stay this matter\npending coordination with other California employment related matters, which was granted and a coordination judge was assigned. The case had been stayed\npending appeal of the denial of a motion to compel arbitration, however the California Supreme Court denied review on January 17, 2024, and the case was\nremitted back to the Superior Court on January 29, 2024 for further proceedings. We intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves. Our chances of success on\nthe merits are still uncertain and any reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated.\nCastellanos v. State (Constitutional Challenge to Proposition 22)\nIn addition, in January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is\nunconstitutional, which was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the\nAlameda County Superior Court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with\nthe California Court of Appeal, and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services organization, who intervened in the matter, has also filed an appeal. Oral argument\nwas heard on December 13, 2022.\nOn March 13, 2023, the California Court of Appeal overturned the lower court\u2019s ruling that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional, which means that Proposition 22\nremains in effect. Service Employees International Union has petitioned the California Supreme Court for review. The California Supreme Court granted review on\nJune 28, 2023, and has set a briefing schedule. We expect a decision in 2024.\nMassachusetts Attorney General Lawsuit\nOn July 9, 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint in Suffolk County Superior Court against Uber and Lyft. The complaint alleges Drivers\nare employees, and are entitled to protections under the wage and labor laws. Trial has been set for May 13, 2024, and the AG is currently only seeking an order\nregarding driver classification without any claims for monetary damages. Our chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any reasonably possible loss\nor range of loss cannot be estimated.\nNew York Attorney General\nThe New York Attorney General has alleged misclassification of Drivers and related employment violations in New York by Uber as well as fraud related to\ncertain deductions. In November 2023, we reached an agreement to resolve this matter. In December 2023, we paid into a settlement fund which will be distributed\nto current and former drivers.\nSwiss Social Security Ruling\nSeveral Swiss administrative bodies have issued decisions in which they classify Drivers as employees of Uber Switzerland, Rasier Operations B.V. or of Uber\nB.V. for social security or labor purposes. We are challenging each of them before the Social Security and Administrative Tribunals.\nIn April 2021, a ruling was made that Uber Switzerland could not be held liable for social security contributions. The litigations with regards to Uber B.V. and\nRasier Operations B.V. are still pending for years 2014 to 2021. In January 2022, the Social Security Tribunal of Zurich reclassified drivers who have used the App\nin 2014 as dependent workers of Uber B.V. and Rasier Operations B.V. from a social security standpoint, and this ruling had been appealed before the Federal\nTribunal and had no impact on our current operations.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4553, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ec3d55b6-df3c-42d4-bfe2-c64bb7cfa592": {"__data__": {"id_": "ec3d55b6-df3c-42d4-bfe2-c64bb7cfa592", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "125", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "43427f0f-49bb-43bf-8bd0-1bdaad515934", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "125", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "23ca0da4799feeb2888b562755f562793e55fbb16ff74c9c2621a83bf4d6a22a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "da953b0b-c59b-4cbb-badb-42b66411923d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "125", "file_name": "uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/uber_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2173740, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "e932464838c2e35778369904a78148b69575ae99faed7bd8a66cf59387887fb1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Swiss Social Security Ruling\nSeveral Swiss administrative bodies have issued decisions in which they classify Drivers as employees of Uber Switzerland, Rasier Operations B.V. or of Uber\nB.V. for social security or labor purposes.

Both assessments were calculated through November 15, 2019, but only calculated the alleged contributions, penalties, and interest owed from\n2014 through 2018. The NJDOL has provided several assessments from February through October 2021. We have submitted payment for the principal revised\namount of the assessment and have since reached agreement on and paid the remaining amounts allegedly owed from 2014 through 2018.\nThe NJ DOL has initiated an audit for the period of 2019 through the second quarter of 2023.

The department issued an assessment in 2016 for the periods of 2013 - 2015 and we have since reached an agreement with the CA EDD\nfor this period. In 2022, we received requests for information related to an audit of a subsequent period, which covers the fourth quarter of 2017 through the fourth\nquarter of 2020. We have also received an audit for the years 2018 - 2020 covering couriers who used the Postmates platform and received an assessment in June\n2023. We are in the process of appealing the assessment.

The purpose of Freight Holding is to\nperform the business activities of the Freight operating segment. The Freight Holding stock held by us was determined to be a variable interest.\nIn October 2020, Freight Holding entered into a Series A preferred stock purchase agreement (\u201c2020 Freight Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement\u201d)\nwith an outside investor (\u201c2020 Freight Series A Investor\u201d) to sell shares of Series A Preferred Stock (\u201cFreight Series A\u201d).\nIn July 2021, we entered into a Freight Series A preferred stock purchase agreement and sold shares of Freight Series A to The Public Investment Fund, which\nis an investor in Uber.\nIn November 2021, Freight Holding entered into a series A-1 stock purchase agreement (\u201c2021 Series A-1 Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement\u201d) with outside\ninvestors (\u201cFreight Series A-1 Investors\u201d) to sell shares of Series A-1 convertible preferred stock of Freight Holding (\u201cFreight Series A-1\u201d).

As of December 31, 2023, there was no balance outstanding on Freight Holding\u2019s revolving credit facility.\nCareem Qatar and Morocco\nOn January 2, 2020, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Careem and certain of its subsidiaries pursuant to an asset purchase\nagreement (the \u201cAsset Purchase Agreement\u201d) in countries where regulatory approval was obtained or which did not require regulatory approval. The assets and\noperations in Qatar and Morocco (collectively \u201cNon-Transferred Countries\u201d) had not yet been transferred to us as of the purchase date. The purpose of the Careem\nQatar and Morocco\u2019s operations is to provide primarily ridesharing services in each respective country. Although the assets and operations of the Non-Transferred\nCountries were not transferred as of the purchase date, we had rights to all residual interests in the entities comprising the Non-Transferred Countries which were\nconsidered variable interests. We were exposed to losses and residual returns of the entities comprising the Non-Transferred Countries through the right to all of the\nproceeds from either the divestiture or the eventual legal transfer, upon regulatory approval, of the entities comprising the Non-Transferred Countries. We\ncontrolled Intellectual Properties (\u201cIP\u201d) which are significant for the businesses of the Non-Transferred Countries and sub-license those IP to the Non-Transferred\nCountries. Each entity that comprised the Non-Transferred Countries met the definition of a VIE and we were the primary beneficiary of each of the entities\ncomprising the Non-Transferred Countries.\nIn September 2021, ownership of Careem\u2019s operations in Morocco was fully transferred to us.\nIn October 2022, Qatar\u2019s Court of Cassation rejected our final appeal for the proposed acquisition of the assets and operations of Careem Qatar. However, we\ncontinue to be exposed to losses and residual returns of the Careem Qatar entity through the right to all of the proceeds from either the divestiture or the eventual\nlegal transfer, upon regulatory approval, of the Careem Qatar entity.

As a result, we obtained the controlling financial interest in CS-Global and accounted for the\nacquisition as a business combination. Cornershop operates as an online grocery delivery platform primarily in Chile and Mexico. Uber and CS-Global also entered\ninto a put/call arrangement over the non-controlling interest in CS-Global, providing Uber the right and obligation to acquire the remaining interest from non-\ncontrolling interest holders, exercisable in 5 years if there is no IPO or liquidation event, at a future negotiated price.\nConcurrent with the CS-Global acquisition transaction, Uber, Cornershop and CS-Global entered into a put/call arrangement over the non-controlling interest\nin CS-Global, providing CS-Global with the right through the call option (and obligation through the put option held by Cornershop) to purchase all of the interests\nin CS-Mexico, contingent upon the receipt of regulatory approval in Mexico (\u201cCS-Mexico Put/Call\u201d). Upon either the exercise of the call option (by CS-Global) or\nthe put option (by Cornershop), CS-Global would acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests in CS-Mexico.\nIn December 2020, we received approval from Mexico\u2019s antitrust regulator to complete the CS-Mexico transaction.

The Company and Indemnitee further agree that Indemnitee shall be entitled to such specific performance and injunctive\nrelief, including temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions, without the necessity of posting bonds or other undertaking in\nconnection therewith.
