Item 1. Business\nOverview\nExpedia Group, Inc. is an online travel company, and our mission is to power global travel for everyone, everywhere. We believe travel is a force for good.\nTravel is an essential human experience that strengthens connections, broadens horizons and bridges divides. We leverage our supply portfolio, platform and\ntechnology capabilities across an extensive portfolio of consumer brands, and provide solutions to our business partners, to empower travelers to efficiently research,\nplan, book and experience travel.\nAt the end of 2023, we had over 3 million lodging properties available, including over 2 million online bookable alternative accommodations listings through\nVrbo, over 940,000 hotels and alternative accommodations through our other brands, over 500 airlines, packages, rental cars, cruises, insurance, as well as activities\nand experiences.\nTravel suppliers distribute and market products via our apps, desktop and mobile offerings, as well as through alternative distribution channels, our business\npartnerships and our call centers in order to reach our extensive global audience. In addition, our advertising and media businesses help other businesses, primarily\ntravel providers, reach a large multi-platform audience of travelers around the globe.\nHistorical Development\nOver 25 years ago, we began operations as one of the first online travel agencies (\u201cOTAs\u201d) and played a significant role in revolutionizing and democratizing\ntravel, by empowering customers to manage their own travel plans. We did so by building and then leveraging proprietary technology to connect partners and their\nrespective inventory to those travelers, while unlocking the marketplace for travel to other businesses as well. Since then, the travel industry has experienced\nsignificant transformation, including the material shift from offline to online travel booking. This transformation led to many years of exciting growth for OTAs\nalong with increased competition. In order to remain innovative and competitive, we made several strategic acquisitions, which materially expanded the breadth and\ndepth of our Company. Much of our strategy leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic focused on our brands competing aggressively for share all the around the world,\neach with their own offerings and benefits. However, it also created certain complexities and inefficiencies over time.\nTo reduce complexity and improve operations, in 2020, we shifted to a platform operating model, which enabled us to deliver more scalable services and\noperate much more efficiently.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5046, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a97b33f4-eb76-4f16-8c93-f3d6dbf65902": {"__data__": {"id_": "a97b33f4-eb76-4f16-8c93-f3d6dbf65902", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "26835cc5-907f-4ca4-9158-8c3cd5d7427e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "0c439ef5666f66c05a02d2e8143b3c1b18761245240770419e3c889f3d323c01", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0aa58479-c437-4467-9234-0a146d0e0b85", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "c9a612c224a75849c01ece740c41191ef97a71747f9adc442cadaa5ade52077f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We did so by building and then leveraging proprietary technology to connect partners and their\nrespective inventory to those travelers, while unlocking the marketplace for travel to other businesses as well.

On November 1, 2021, the sale of Egencia to American Express Global Business\nTravel (\u201cGBT\u201d) was completed. As part of the transaction, Expedia Group received a minority ownership position in the combined business and entered into a 10-\nyear lodging supply agreement with GBT. Both Egencia pre-closing and the GBT lodging supply agreement impact our B2B segment financials. The result of these\ncumulative actions enables more focus on improving the overall experience for our travelers.\nIn 2021, we began evolving our consumer retail strategy from being largely transactionally focused, where we were primarily focused on acquiring customers\nthrough performance marketing channels to building direct, longer-lasting relationships with our customers. With that goal in mind, we focused towards increasing\ncustomer loyalty and app adoption as loyalty members and app users typically experience higher repeat rates, gross profits and bookings relative to non-loyalty\nmembers and non-app users. Further, we aim to provide our customers with a high-quality product experience, strong membership benefits and broad multi-product\nsupply offering, all of which encourages higher conversion, repeat rates and engagement.\nAs part of our platform operating model strategy, we migrated both the Hotels.com and Vrbo front-end stacks onto the Brand Expedia stack and created one\nunified front-end stack in 2023, which increases our test-and-learn capacity and feature release velocity while also providing a scalable and efficient base to operate\nupon. We also launched One Key in the United States, which serves as the unified loyalty program under Brand Expedia, Hotels.com and Vrbo, enabling travelers to\ncross-earn and cross-redeem awards across these brands and our range of products such as air, hotels and alternative accommodations. One Key will also be launched\nin more countries going forward.\nMarket Opportunity and Business Strategy\nExpedia Group is one of the world\u2019s largest online travel companies, yet our gross bookings represent a single-digit percentage of total worldwide travel\nspending highlighting the size of our market opportunity. Phocuswright estimates global travel spending, inclusive of alternative accommodations and tours and\nactivities, at approximately $2 trillion in 2024.\nOur focus is to: leverage our brand, supply, and platform technology strength, to provide greater services and value to our travelers, suppliers and business\npartners, and build longer-lasting direct relationships with our customers.\nLeverage Brand and Supply Strength to Power the Travel Ecosystem. We believe the strength of our core brand portfolio and consistent enhancements to\nproduct and service offerings, combined with our global scale and broad-based supply, drive increasing value to customers and customer demand. With our\nsignificant global audience of travelers, and our deep and broad selection of travel products, we are also able to provide value to supply partners seeking to grow their\nbusiness through sophisticated technology, a better understanding of travel retailing and reaching consumers in markets beyond their reach. Our deep product and\nsupply footprint allows us to tailor offerings to target different types of consumers and travel needs, employ geographic segmentation in markets around the world,\nand leverage brand differentiation, among other benefits. We also market to consumers through a variety of channels, including internet search, metasearch and social\nand digital media.\nOur portfolio of brands, operated and organized by reportable segment are as follows:\nB2C.

During 2020, Expedia Group unified its\ntechnology, product, data engineering, and data science teams to build services and capabilities that can be leveraged across our business units to provide value-add\nservices to our travel suppliers and serve our end customers. The unified team structure enables us to deliver more scalable services and operate more efficiently. We\nhave also completed the migration of our core B2C brands onto a unified Brand Expedia technology front-end infrastructure, having migrated Hotels.com onto the\ninfrastructure in 2022 and Vrbo in 2023.\nAs we continue to mature our shared platform infrastructure, our focus is on developing configurable technical capabilities that support various travel products\nwhile using simpler, standard architecture and common applications and frameworks. We believe this strategy will enable us to: simultaneously build pieces of\ntechnology that work in tandem; ship new capabilities and features faster; create a foundation for more innovative solutions; and achieve greater economies of scope\nand scale. Ultimately, we believe this will result in more product improvements faster and therefore better traveler experiences.

For example, we provide travelers access to book hotel room reservations through our contracts with lodging suppliers, which provide us with\nrates and availability information for rooms but for which we have no control over the rooms and do not bear inventory risk.

The majority of our merchant transactions relate to\nlodging bookings.\n\u2022Agency Model. Under the agency model, we facilitate travel bookings and act as the agent in the transaction, passing reservations booked by the traveler to\nthe relevant travel provider.

Travelers typically select packages based on the total package\nprice or by purchasing one product and receiving a discounted price to attach additional products. The use of the merchant model enables us to make certain multi-\nproduct purchases available at prices lower than those charged on an individual component basis without impacting their other pricing models. In addition, we also\noffer pre-assembled package offerings, further broadening our scope of products and services to travelers. We expect the package product to continue to be marketed\nprimarily using the merchant model.\nMarketing and Promotions\nOur marketing programs are intended to build and maintain the value of our B2C brands, drive traffic and ultimately bookings while optimizing ongoing\ntraveler acquisition costs. Our long-term success and profitability depend on our continued ability to maintain and increase the overall number of traveler transactions\nflowing through our brand and shared platforms in a cost-effective manner, as well as our ability to attract repeat customers and customers that come directly to our\nbrands. We manage our marketing investments holistically across the brand portfolio in our B2C segment to optimize results for the Company and make decisions on\na market by market and customer segment basis that we think are appropriate based on the relative growth opportunity, the expected returns and the competitive\nenvironment.\nOur marketing channels primarily include brand advertising through online and offline channels, loyalty programs, mobile apps, search engine marketing and\noptimization as well as metasearch, social media, direct and/or personalized traveler communications on our websites as well as through direct e-mail communication\nwith our travelers. Our marketing programs and initiatives include promotional offers such as coupons as well as seasonal or periodic special offers from our travel\nsuppliers based on our supplier relationships. Most recently, we unified our existing loyalty programs into one global rewards platform called One Key spanning all\nour major brands, which launched in the United States in July 2023 with additional markets to follow.\nWe also make use of affiliate marketing.

The emphasis on one or more of these factors varies, depending on the brand or business and the related target\ndemographic. We face increasing competition from travel supplier direct websites. In some cases, supplier direct channels offer advantages to travelers, such as their\nown specific loyalty programs, complimentary services such as Wi-Fi, and better pricing. Our websites and apps feature travel products and services from numerous\ntravel suppliers and allow travelers to combine products and services from multiple providers in one transaction.

of Class B common stock and shares of Expedia Group common stock. the Company's stockholders subsequently approved a proposal\nto amend the Company's certificate of incorporation to reflect these restrictions.\nOn November 2, 2021, in connection with the settlement of stockholder litigation relating to the Liberty Expedia Transaction, Mr. Diller, the other defendants,\nthe Special Litigation

Item 1A. Risk Factors         \nYou should carefully consider each of the following risks and uncertainties associated with our company and the ownership of our securities. If any of the\nfollowing risks occur, our business and/or financial performance could be materially adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us\nor that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business and/or financial performance.\nIndustry Risks\nWe operate in an intensely competitive global environment and we may be unable to compete successfully with our current or future competitors.\nThe market for the services we offer is intensely competitive. We compete with both established and emerging online and traditional providers of travel-related\nservices, including online travel agencies; alternative accommodation providers; wholesalers and tour operators; travel product suppliers (including hotels, airlines\nand car rental companies); search engines and large online portal websites; travel metasearch services; corporate travel management service providers; mobile\nplatform travel applications; social media websites; eCommerce and group buying websites; B2B businesses and other participants in the travel industry.\nOnline travel agencies and alternative accommodations providers. In particular, we face intense competition from other OTAs and alternative accommodation\nproviders in many regions, such as Booking Holdings (through its Booking.com, Priceline.com and Agoda.com brands), Airbnb, and Trip.com, any of which may\nhave more favorable offerings for travelers or suppliers, including pricing and supply breadth. Our OTA competitors are increasingly expanding the range of travel\nservices they offer and the global OTA segment continues to consolidate, with certain competitors merging or forming strategic partnerships. Airbnb, Booking\nHoldings and other providers of alternative accommodations provide an alternative to hotel rooms and compete with alternative accommodation properties available\nthrough Expedia Group brands, including Vrbo. The continued growth of alternative accommodation providers could affect overall travel patterns generally, and the\ndemand for our services specifically, in facilitating reservations at hotels and alternative accommodations. Furthermore, Airbnb has, and similar providers could,\nincreasingly look to add other travel services, such as tours, activities, hotel and flight bookings, any of which could further extend their reach into the travel market\nas they seek to compete with the traditional OTAs.\nTravel suppliers. Travel suppliers, such as hotels, airlines and rental car companies, may offer products and services on more favorable terms to consumers\nwho transact directly with them. Many of these competitors have been steadily focusing on increasing online demand on their own websites and mobile applications\nin lieu of third-party distributors through favorable rates and bonus or loyalty points for direct bookings, surcharges for booking outside of the supplier\u2019s own website\nor preferred booking technologies, suppliers combining to establish a single search platform and other tactics to drive traffic directly to supplier websites.\nSearch engines and large online portal websites. We also face intense competition from Google and other search engines. There could be a material adverse\nimpact on our business and financial performance to the extent that Google continues to use its market position to disintermediate online travel agencies through its\nown offerings or capabilities, refer customers directly to suppliers or other favored partners, increase the cost of traffic directed to our websites, offer the ability to\ntransact on its own website, or promote its own competing products by placing its own offerings at the top of organic search results.\nIn recent years, search engines have increased their focus on acquiring or launching travel products that provide increasingly comprehensive travel planning\ncontent and direct booking capabilities, comparable to OTAs. For example, Google has continued to add features and functionality to its Google Travel, Google\nFlights, Hotel Ads and alternative accommodations metasearch products. In addition, Google may be able to leverage the data they collect on users to the detriment\nof us and other OTAs. Search engines may also continue to expand their voice and artificial intelligence (\"AI\") capabilities. To the extent these actions have a\nnegative effect on our search traffic or the cost of acquiring such traffic, our business and financial performance could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, our brands, or brands in which we hold a significant ownership position, including trivago, compete for advertising revenue with these search\nengines, as well as with large internet portal sites that offer advertising opportunities for travel-related companies.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5511, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d32f49d8-a1e9-40ce-a688-e6a0d61ad019": {"__data__": {"id_": "d32f49d8-a1e9-40ce-a688-e6a0d61ad019", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7126af12-7b72-4bf3-a226-8ce6326e18d7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "961bd4433c45ec5e0eb40a93bbbc85230fdbcba70e955e2aa2306f890fcc4fe0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "032c54e5-b5a1-4bdb-bcbe-df1b114a9270", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "c255b40a82d8b5f11b1b74392ba331342e911557ade7e0386146fdf03cf2e7ca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In recent years, search engines have increased their focus on acquiring or launching travel products that provide increasingly comprehensive travel planning\ncontent and direct booking capabilities, comparable to OTAs.

Travel metasearch websites, including Kayak.com (a subsidiary of Booking Holdings), trivago (a majority-owned subsidiary of\nExpedia Group), TripAdvisor, Skyscanner and Qunar (both are subsidiaries of Trip.com), aggregate travel search results for a specific itinerary across supplier, travel\nagent and other websites. In addition, some metasearch websites have looked to add various forms of direct or assisted booking functionality to their sites in direct\ncompetition with certain of our brands.

Traditional consumer eCommerce platforms, including Amazon and Alibaba, and group buying websites have\nperiodically undertaken efforts to expand their local offerings into the travel market. For example, traditional consumer eCommerce and group buying websites may\nadd hotel offers or other travel services to their sites. To the extent our travelers use these websites, these websites may create additional competition and could\nnegatively affect our businesses.\nB2B businesses. Our B2B business faces competition from other online travel agencies with B2B offerings as well as other competitors such as independent\nB2B businesses. If we are unable to deliver competitive supply, products, features and commercial terms to our B2B partners, this may result in slower growth and/or\na loss of share.\nOther participants in the travel industry. Other participants or existing competitors may begin to offer or expand other services to the travel industry that\ncompete with the services we offer to our travelers, our travel industry affiliates and partners, or our corporate clients. For example, ride-sharing apps increasingly\ncompete with traditional car rental services and are adding other transportation and experience offerings, and travel services continue to proliferate. To the extent any\nof these services gain market share over time, it may create additional competition and could negatively affect our businesses.\nIn general, increased competition has resulted in, and may continue to result in, reduced margins, as well as loss of travelers, transactions and brand recognition\nand we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against any current, emerging and future competitors or on platforms that may emerge, or\noffer differentiated products and services to our travelers. Increasing competition from current and emerging competitors, the introduction of new technologies and\nthe continued expansion of existing technologies, such as metasearch and other search engine technologies, may force us to make changes to our business models,\nwhich could affect our financial performance and liquidity.

Any associated decrease in demand, depending on its scope and duration, together with any future issues affecting travel safety, could significantly and\nadversely affect our business, working capital and financial performance over the short and long-term.\nIn addition, the disruption of the existing travel plans of a significant number of travelers upon the occurrence of certain of these events, such as severe weather\nconditions, fires, actual or threatened terrorist activity, war or travel-related health events, could result in significant additional costs and decrease our revenues\nleading to constrained liquidity, particularly if we, as we often have done historically in the case of severe weather conditions and travel-related health events,\nprovide relief to affected travelers by refunding the price or fees associated with airline tickets, hotel reservations and other travel products and services.\nOur business depends on our relationships with travel suppliers and other B2B partners.\nAn important component of our business success depends on our ability to maintain and expand relationships with travel suppliers (including owners and\nmanagers of alternative accommodation properties), GDS partners and B2B partners. A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from compensation negotiated\nwith travel suppliers, in particular lodging suppliers, airlines and GDS partners for bookings made through our channels. We typically negotiate or renegotiate\nnumerous supplier contracts each year. No assurances can be given that travel suppliers will elect to participate in our platform, or that our compensation, access to\ninventory or access to inventory at competitive rates will not be further reduced or eliminated in the future, or that travel suppliers will not reduce the cost of their\nproducts or services (for example, ADRs or ticket prices); attempt to implement costly direct connections; charge us for or otherwise restrict access to content;\nincrease credit card fees or fees for other services; fail to provide us with accurate booking information or otherwise take actions that would increase our operating\nexpenses. Likewise, no assurance can be given that our current B2B partners will continue to participate in our platform or that our compensation will not be\nreduced. Any of these actions, or other similar actions, could reduce our revenue and margins thereby adversely affecting our business and financial performance.\nFinancial Risks\nWe may experience constraints in our liquidity due to factors out of our control and may be unable to access capital when necessary or desirable, either of\nwhich could harm our financial position.\nIf our liquidity is materially diminished, as it was during the COVID-19 pandemic, we may not be able to timely pay debts, leases, or comply with material\nprovisions of our contractual obligations.

Our indebtedness, the availability of assets as collateral for loans or other indebtedness, and market conditions may make it difficult for us to raise\nadditional capital on commercially reasonable terms to meet potential future liquidity needs.\nIn addition to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other potential pandemic or health-related events, we have experienced, and may experience in the\nfuture, declines in seasonal liquidity and capital provided by our merchant hotel business, which has historically provided a meaningful portion of our operating cash\nflow and is dependent on several factors, including the rate of growth of our merchant hotel business and the relative growth of businesses which consume rather\nthan\n11", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5164, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a292b297-edf9-4750-96a0-a1badcffea79": {"__data__": {"id_": "a292b297-edf9-4750-96a0-a1badcffea79", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "19e858b9-22fd-4b3b-97ad-ad9d7249fea1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "7a94c40619e3001a8dfde0a743d1ebed9838af9305f21401fc94f2809d1e2f5b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\ngenerate working capital, such as our agency hotel, and advertising businesses, and payment terms with suppliers.

Such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt, which\nacceleration may trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions in other debt. In addition, lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to\nsupply us with further funds. In addition, it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business or otherwise.\nThe terms of our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes allow us to incur additional debt subject to certain limitations.

Moreover, the payment card networks could adopt\nnew operating rules or interpret or reinterpret existing rules that we or our payment processors might find difficult or even impossible to comply with, or costly to\nimplement. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are breached or compromised, we may lose our ability to accept\ncredit and debit card payments from our customers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and be liable for card issuing banks\u2019 costs, subject to fines and higher\ntransaction fees, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to payments-related fraud risks.\nOur results of operations and financial positions have been negatively affected by our acceptance of fraudulent bookings made using payment options\nincluding credit and debit cards or fraudulently obtained loyalty points. We are sometimes held liable for accepting fraudulent bookings on our websites or other\nbookings for which payment is subsequently disputed by our customers both of which lead to the reversal of payments received by us for such bookings (referred to\nas a \u201ccharge-back\u201d). In addition, the payment card networks have rules around acceptable charge-back ratios. Accordingly, we calculate and record an allowance for\nthe resulting charge-backs. Our ability to detect and combat fraudulent schemes, which have become increasingly common and sophisticated, may be negatively\nimpacted by the adoption of new payment methods, the emergence and innovation of new technology platforms (such as historically occurred with the introduction\nof smartphones, tablet computers and in-home assistants), and our global expansion, including into markets with a history of elevated fraudulent activity. In addition,\nwe have not broadly adopted certain protective capabilities across our platform, such as mobile application-based multi-factor authentication or third-party identify\nverification, which approach could result in significantly increased fraudulent activity on our platform in the future.\nIf we are unable to effectively combat fraudulent bookings on our websites or mobile applications or if we otherwise experience increased levels of charge\nbacks, we may also be subject to significant fines and higher transaction fees or payment card networks may revoke our access to their networks meaning we would\nbe unable to continue to accept card payments, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial positions.\nIn addition, we may be subject to fraudulent supplier schemes. For example, when onboarding suppliers to our websites, we may fail to identify falsified or\nstolen supplier credentials, which may result in fraudulent bookings or unauthorized access to personal or confidential information of users of our websites and\nmobile applications. A fraudulent supplier scheme could also result in negative publicity, damage to our reputation, and could cause users of our websites and mobile\napplications to lose confidence in the quality of our services.\nThe rapid evolution and increased adoption of AI technologies may increase the risk of fraudulent bookings and fraudulent supplier scheme risks. Any of these\nevents could have a significant negative effect on the value of our brands, which could have an adverse impact on our financial performance.\nWe work closely with various business partners and rely on third-parties for many systems and services, and therefore could be harmed by their activities.\nWe have numerous significant commercial arrangements with business partners, and we rely on third-party service providers for a broad ranges of key services,\nincluding both external, customer-facing services such as customer support and booking fulfillment and internal services related to our operations, technology\ndevelopment and infrastructure. If these partners or service providers fail to meet our requirements or legal or regulatory requirements, it could damage our\nreputation, make it difficult for us to operate some aspects of our business, or expose us to liability for their actions.

Some of our most significant initiatives are described above in Part I. Item 1. Business, under the caption \u201cMarket Opportunity and Business\nStrategy.\u201d We may not realize the benefits we expect to achieve from these and our other strategic initiatives or our efforts may negatively impact our business and\noperations due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, unexpected delays, operational or technological challenges, or higher than expected costs or\nexpenses. As a result, our business operations, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted.\nWe are exposed to various counterparty risks.\nWe are exposed to the risk that various counterparties, including financial entities, will fail to perform. This creates risk in a number of areas, including with\nrespect to our bank deposits and investments, foreign exchange risk management, insurance coverages, letters of credit, and for certain of our transactions, the receipt\nand holding of traveler payments and subsequent remittance of a portion of those payments to travel suppliers. As it relates to deposits, as of December 31, 2023, we\nheld cash in bank depository accounts of approximately $4.0 billion and money market funds of approximately $168 million. Additionally, majority-owned\nsubsidiaries held cash of approximately $42 million and held term deposits of approximately $99 million. As it relates to foreign exchange, as of December 31, 2023,\nwe were party to forward contracts with a notional value of approximately $3.7 billion, the fair value of which was a net liability of approximately $9 million. We\nemploy forward contracts to hedge a portion of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. At the end of the deposit term or upon the maturity of the\nforward contracts, the counterparties are obligated, or potentially obligated in the case of forward contracts, to return our funds or pay us net settlement values. If any\nof these counterparties were to liquidate, declare bankruptcy or otherwise cease operations, it may not be able to satisfy its obligations under these term deposits or\nforward contracts, our ability to recover losses or to access or recover our assets held may be limited by the counterparty\u2019s liquidity or the applicable laws governing\nthe insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding, and the receipt and remittance of payments via such counterparties would be severely limited or cease. In addition, we face\nsignificant credit risk and potential payment delays with respect to non-financial contract counterparties including our B2B and Vrbo partners, which may be\nexacerbated by economic downturns. The realization of any of these risks could have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance.\nWe have foreign exchange risk.\nWe face exposure to movements in currency exchange rates (particularly those related to the Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Brazilian\nreal, and Japanese Yen currencies) that revalue our cash flows, monetary assets and liabilities, and translate our foreign subsidiary financial results to U.S. dollars. In\nparticular, we face exposure related to fluctuations in accommodation revenue due to relative currency movements from the time of booking to the time of stay as\nwell as the impact of relative exchange rate movements on cross-border travel such as from Europe to the United States and the United States to Europe.\nDepending on the size of the exposures and the relative movements of exchange rates, if we choose not to hedge or fail to hedge effectively our exposure, we\ncould experience a material adverse effect on our financial statements and financial condition.

Even with these precautions, however, third parties may copy or otherwise\nobtain and use our intellectual property or confusingly similar trademarks or domain names without our authorization or to develop similar intellectual property\nindependently. Effective trademark, domain name, copyright, patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every jurisdiction in which our services are\navailable and policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and expensive. We cannot be sure that the steps we have taken will prevent\nmisappropriation or infringement of intellectual property. Any misappropriation or violation of our rights could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFurthermore, we may need to go to court or other tribunals to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and\nscope of the proprietary rights of others. These proceedings might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention.\nWe currently license from third parties some of the technologies, content, and brands incorporated into our websites. We also license content from suppliers for\nour creative campaigns. As we continue to build our creative production work and introduce new services that incorporate new technologies, content and brands, we\nmay be required to license additional technology, content, and brands. We cannot be sure that such technology, content and brand licenses will be available on\ncommercially reasonable terms, if at all. We also cannot be sure that content obtained from suppliers won\u2019t be subject to intellectual property infringement claims by\na third party.\nTechnology, Information Protection and Privacy Risks\nWe rely on information technology to operate our businesses and maintain our competitiveness, and if we fail to adequately maintain or improve our\ninformation technology systems, or to adapt them to technological developments and industry trends, our business and operations could be adversely\naffected.\nWe depend on the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems in many areas of our business including technology and systems used for website\nand mobile applications, reservations, customer service, supplier connectivity, marketing, communications, procurement, payments, tax collection and remittance,\nfraud detection and administration, which we must continuously improve and upgrade. Our future success also depends on our ability to adapt our services and\ninfrastructure to meet rapidly evolving consumer trends and demands while continuing to improve the performance, features and reliability of our service in response\nto competitive service and product offerings. Cloud computing, the continued growth of alternative platforms and mobile computing devices, the emergence of niche\ncompetitors who may be able to optimize products, services or strategies that use cloud computing or for such platforms, as well as other technological changes,\nincluding new devices, services and home assistants, and developing technologies, have, and will continue to require, new and costly investments. Transitioning to\nthese new technologies may be disruptive to resources and the services we provide and may increase our reliance on third party service providers.\nMost recently, we have incorporated third-party AI technology in certain of our products, services and business operations. Our research, development and\ndeployment of AI technologies remains ongoing. AI presents risks, challenges, and unintended consequences that could affect our and our customers\u2019 adoption and\nuse of this technology. AI algorithms and training methodologies may be flawed. Additionally, AI technologies are complex and rapidly evolving, and we face\nsignificant competition in the market from other companies regarding the research, development and deployment of such technologies. While we aim to develop and\ndeploy AI responsibly and attempt to identify and mitigate ethical and legal issues presented by its use, we may be unsuccessful in identifying or resolving issues\nbefore they arise. AI-related issues, deficiencies and/or failures could (i) give rise to legal and/or regulatory action as a result of new applications of existing data\nprotection, privacy, intellectual property, and other laws, including with respect to proposed legislation regulating AI in jurisdictions in which we operate; (ii) damage\nour reputation; or (iii) otherwise materially harm our business.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5494, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8660791c-9669-490f-80e8-1ebad46fce91": {"__data__": {"id_": "8660791c-9669-490f-80e8-1ebad46fce91", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5c86bbaa-b230-4f46-888a-c0b3642c5969", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "5e07b08d876ff5d3d1fd7cd0a0beeecda4205525070464264223410f5c3067bc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5d1372eb-0da4-483c-81f7-e4579055fa1c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "523de63255b53e366bf27bd63ff3ee027baa38f345c05e59d71cb347992b8851", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Our research, development and\ndeployment of AI technologies remains ongoing.

Due to the size and scale of\nour technology infrastructure and overall operations, vulnerabilities present within our systems may result in unauthorized access to confidential data including our\nown proprietary data, that of our partners or the personal data of our customers, including payment data. In addition, given the nature of our operations, consumer\npersonal and payment data may also be accessed inappropriately within partner systems should those partners also experience a breach.\nIn addition, we continue to encounter attempted external attacks in a variety of forms, including ransomware, account takeovers, phishing, disinformation, and\ndenial of service attacks. Additionally, some actors are using AI technology to launch more sophisticated, automated, targeted and coordinated attacks that are more\ndifficult to detect. As these continue, there is a risk that successful attacks may cause a significant cybersecurity incident which impacts our critical operations.\nSuccessful attacks have the potential to damage our reputation, increase costs, and result in regulatory scrutiny or fines.\nAs we continue to migrate legacy systems to newer information technology systems, we increase the risk of system interruptions.

Practices regarding the\ncollection, use, storage, transmission and security of personal information by companies operating over the internet have recently come under increased public\nscrutiny. Several U.S. states, including California, have passed comprehensive privacy legislation or are considering privacy legislation. In addition, the General Data\nProtection Regulation, or GDPR, that went into effect in the European Union in May 2018, requires companies to implement and remain compliant with regulations\nregarding the handling of personal data. Enforcement of GDPR regulations, and fines for non-compliance, continue to increase and a significant number of additional\njurisdictions are expected to enact similar privacy regulations in the future. As additional jurisdictions enact privacy regulations and laws, we will experience\nincreased compliance costs and uncertainty as to how such laws will be interpreted. Although we have invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant\nresources to comply with the GDPR and other privacy laws and regulations, the number and variety of regulations combined with our multi-product, multi-brand,\nglobal businesses, could nevertheless result in compliance failures.

This corporate opportunity provision may have the effect of exacerbating the risk of conflicts of interest between the companies\nbecause the provision effectively shields an overlapping director/executive officer from liability for breach of fiduciary duty in the event that such director or officer\nchooses to direct a corporate opportunity to IAC instead of Expedia Group.\nIncreased focus on our environmental, social, and governance (\"ESG\") responsibilities have and will likely continue to result in additional costs and risks,\nand may adversely impact our reputation, employee retention, and willingness of customers and partners to do business with us.\n22", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3989, "end_char_idx": 5609, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fb6890ac-e68c-48b0-b25b-7ef3ca7da9c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "fb6890ac-e68c-48b0-b25b-7ef3ca7da9c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "da0295a3-ea41-4b35-9811-b2811b6edc5e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "87f7c1aee3050b83ab53564046e78a631b1e7f7bf65e03cbcc3a78251af5d630", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nInstitutional, individual, and other investors, proxy advisory services, regulatory authorities, consumers, employees and other stakeholders are increasingly\nfocused on ESG practices of companies, including climate change, diversity, equity and inclusion, human capital management, data privacy and security, supply\nchains (including human rights issues), among other topics. These evolving stakeholder expectations and our efforts and ability to respond to and manage these\nissues, provide updates on them, and establish and meet appropriate goals, commitments, and targets present numerous operational, regulatory, reputational,\nfinancial, legal, and other risks and impacts, any of which may be outside of our control or could have a material adverse impact on our business, including on our\nreputation and stock price. Our efforts in this area may result in a significant increase in costs and may nevertheless not meet investor or other stakeholder\nexpectations and evolving standards or regulatory requirements, which may negatively impact our financial results, our reputation, our ability to attract or retain\nemployees, our attractiveness as a service provider, investment, or business partner, or expose us to government enforcement actions, private litigation, and actions\nby stockholders or stakeholders.\nMoreover, we may be subject to criticism by ESG detractors for our ESG initiatives or for any revisions made to these initiatives. We may also be subject to\nadverse responses by government entities, like anti-ESG laws or punitive legislative actions, or from consumers, through actions like boycotts or adverse media\ncampaigns, aimed at Expedia Group that could negatively affect our reputation, business operations, financial results, and growth.\nClimate change may have an adverse impact on our business.\nOur businesses may also be negatively impacted by direct and indirect impacts of climate change. Direct impacts may include disruptions to travel and to our\noperations due to more frequent or severe storms, hurricanes, flooding, rising sea levels, shortages of water, droughts and wildfires. Indirect impacts may include a\nsignificant shift in consumer preferences, which we may not successfully adapt to, or the general harm to our business as a result of a general perception of travel as\nan environmental harm. These and other climate change related impacts could have a significant adverse impact on our business in both the short, medium and long\nterm. Further, there is uncertainty around the accounting standards and climate-related disclosures associated with emerging laws and reporting requirements and the\nrelated costs to comply with the emerging regulations could be significant.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Stock\nOur stock price is highly volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock is highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to, among other risks, the risks\ndescribed in this Item 1A, as well as:\n\u2022 quarterly variations in our operating and financial results as well as those of our peer companies;\n\u2022 operating and financial results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors, including failure to meet or exceed forward-looking\nguidance we have given or deliver expected returns on investments or key initiatives;\n\u2022 changes in our capital or governance structure;\n\u2022 repurchases of our common stock, including failure to meet internal or external expectations around the timing or price of shares repurchases, and any\nreductions or discontinuances of repurchase activities;\n\u2022 changes in the stock price or market valuations of trivago, our majority-owned, publicly traded subsidiary, whose stock price is also highly volatile;\n\u2022 changes in device and platform technologies and search industry dynamics, such as key word pricing and traffic, or other changes that negatively affect\nour ability to generate traffic to our websites;\n\u2022 announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, divestitures, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments\nas well as technological innovations, new services or promotional and discounting activities;\n\u2022 dilution resulting from any conversion of our convertible debt into common stock;\n\u2022 loss of a major travel supplier, such as an airline, hotel or car rental chain; and\n\u2022 lack of success in our efforts to increase our market share.\nIn addition, if the market for technology stocks or the greater securities market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our\ncommon stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nPart I. Item 1C. Cybersecurity\nThe Company\u2019s Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) recognizes that safeguarding the Company\u2019s data, information systems, and technology assets is critical to\nmaintaining the trust and confidence of the Company\u2019s travelers, business partners and employees. The Board actively exercises oversight of the Company\u2019s\ntechnological infrastructure, information security and its cybersecurity, which are key components of the Company\u2019s risk management program. The Company\u2019s\ncybersecurity policies, standards, processes and programs are integrated into its risk management program and are based on industry standard frameworks established\nby the National Institute of Standards and Technology (\"NIST\") and the International Organization for Standardization, among others, as well as on evolving best\npractices.\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nThe Company\u2019s cybersecurity risk management program is composed of the following key elements:\n\u2022Governance. As discussed in more detail under the heading \u201cCybersecurity Governance\u201d below, as part of its general oversight duties, the Board oversees\nthe Company\u2019s risk management, including its cybersecurity risks. The Board is supported in its oversight of cybersecurity risks by the Audit Committee,\nwhich regularly interacts with the Company\u2019s risk management function, the Company\u2019s Chief Security Officer (\u201cCSO\u201d) and the Company\u2019s Chief\nTechnology Officer (\u201cCTO\u201d).\n\u2022Risk Assessment and Management. The Company\u2019s cybersecurity risk management program is based on industry standard information security principles\nand best practices, specifically the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (\"PCI DSS\"). The program\nencompasses all Company directly-managed brands, entities, and internal organizations other than its publicly-traded trivago subsidiary, which has its own\nstandalone cybersecurity risk management program, and uses a proactive approach to regularly identify and assess cybersecurity threats, vulnerabilities and\nrisks, and to evaluate the effectiveness of implemented security controls through internal audits, external threat intelligence, and periodic external\nindependent assessments. Risks identified and assessed through the cybersecurity risk management program are then communicated to the Company\u2019s\nsenior leadership team and used to prioritize risks based on their potential impact and likelihood as part of the Company\u2019s dynamic risk response strategy.\n\u2022Technical Safeguards and Incident Response. The Company classifies its electronic data and information systems based on the sensitivity and criticality of\nthe data involved and deploys commensurate technical safeguards, including but not limited to firewalls, encryption, network segmentation, real-time\nmonitoring, intrusion prevention systems, anti-malware, and access controls. The Company\u2019s cybersecurity incident response plan, modeled on NIST 800-\n61, is built on a comprehensive framework which sets forth guidance and procedures required for the life cycle of an incident. The plan establishes\nprocesses for use by a cross-functional cybersecurity incident response team with the resources necessary to take action in a timely and decisive manner\nduring the response, investigation, and remediation of an incident, and to comply with legal obligations. The Company tests, trains, and evaluates its\nincident response capabilities on at least an annual basis and updates its incident response plan accordingly. The Company also maintains insurance\ncoverage for cybersecurity incidents.\n\u2022Third-Party Risk Management. The Company\u2019s external service provider management program requires all third-party service providers to comply with the\nCompany\u2019s security standards, including notification procedures in the event of an incident involving Company confidential information. The Company\nrequires its service providers to ensure that their own third-party vendors and subcontractors comply with the Company\u2019s security standards when working\nwith Company information. In addition, the Company performs diligence on external service providers and their vendors that have access to the Company's\ninformation and/or information systems, and conducts ongoing monitoring throughout the life of the relationship, including re-assessments in light of any\nsignificant changes to the provider\u2019s security controls or technical landscape.\n\u2022Education and Awareness. The Company\u2019s mandatory annual cybersecurity employee training program covers critical aspects of digital security, including\nphishing prevention, threat awareness and safe data handling practices. The annual training program is regularly refreshed based on the evolving security\nlandscape and secure code development. It is also supplemented by awareness initiatives to keep Company personnel updated on cybersecurity threats and\nthe latest security policies and instill a culture of security mindfulness across the organization.\n\u2022Continuous Review. The Company regularly reviews its cybersecurity policies, standards, and programs and evaluates the effectiveness of implemented\nsecurity controls. In addition to performing internal audits, assessments, tabletop exercises, and vulnerability testing, the Company periodically engages\nthird parties to perform information security\n24", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5402, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3175ac37-4dd5-4e5c-a07d-1d1a51267651": {"__data__": {"id_": "3175ac37-4dd5-4e5c-a07d-1d1a51267651", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ed9f5bb0-a3e5-439e-a73f-0413a80d7074", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "1ee6d33c8e16a3f1d47e1901504351d881ef71eb135ead3d9f40375e98b4f02d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nmaturity assessments, audits, cyber breach root cause analysis, and independent reviews of its information security control environment and operating\neffectiveness.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nIn the ordinary course of business, Expedia Group and its subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings and claims involving property, personal injury, contract,\nalleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights and other statutory and common law claims. The amounts that may be recovered in such matters may\nbe subject to insurance coverage.\nRules of the SEC require the description of material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary, routine litigation incident to the registrant\u2019s business, and\nadvise that proceedings ordinarily need not be described if they primarily involve damages claims for amounts (exclusive of interest and costs) not individually\nexceeding 10% of the current assets of the registrant and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. In the judgment of management, none of the pending litigation\nmatters that the Company and its subsidiaries are defending, including those described below, involves or is likely to involve amounts of that magnitude. The\nlitigation matters described below involve issues or claims that may be of particular interest to our stockholders, regardless of whether any of these matters may be\nmaterial to our financial position or results of operations based upon the standard set forth in the SEC\u2019s rules.\nLitigation Relating to Occupancy and Other Taxes\nA number of jurisdictions in the United States have filed lawsuits against online travel companies, including Expedia Group companies such as Hotels.com,\nExpedia, Hotwire, Orbitz and HomeAway, claiming that such travel companies have failed to collect and/or pay taxes (e.g., occupancy taxes, business privilege taxes,\nexcise taxes, sales taxes, etc.), as well as related claims such as unjust enrichment, restitution, conversion and violation of consumer protection statutes, and seeking\nmonetary (including tax, interest, and penalties), injunctive and/or declaratory relief. In addition, we may file complaints contesting tax assessments made by states,\ncounties and municipalities seeking to obligate online travel companies, including certain Expedia Group companies, to collect and remit certain taxes, either\nretroactively or prospectively, or both. Moreover, certain jurisdictions may require us to pay tax assessments prior to contesting any such assessments. This\nrequirement is commonly referred to as \u201cpay-to-play.\u201d Payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes and, even when\nsuch payments are made, we continue to defend our position vigorously.\nActions Filed by Individual States, Cities and Counties\nPine Bluff, Arkansas Litigation. In September 2009, Pine Bluff Advertising and Promotion Commission and Jefferson County filed a putative class action\nagainst a number of online travel companies, including Expedia, Hotels.com, Hotwire and Orbitz, alleging that defendants failed to collect and/or pay taxes under\nhotel tax occupancy ordinances. In February 2018, the trial court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment and denied defendants\u2019 motion for summary\njudgment on the issue of tax liability. On February 24, 2023, the trial court issued final judgment against the defendant online travel companies. The defendants filed\na notice of appeal to the Arkansas Supreme Court on March 23, 2023. That appeal remains pending.\nState of Mississippi Litigation. In December 2011, the State of Mississippi brought suit against a number of online travel companies, including Expedia,\nHotels.com, Hotwire and Orbitz, for declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, violations of the state sales tax statute and local ordinances, violation of Consumer\nProtection Act (subsequently dismissed), conversion, unjust enrichment, constructive trust, money had and received and joint venture liability. In October 2018, the\ntrial court granted the State of Mississippi\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability, after which the case proceeded to a damages phase in the trial\ncourt. In a July 12, 2021 final judgment, the trial court found the defendant online travel companies liable for state and local sales taxes and interest and also held the\ndefendants liable for penalties. The defendants appealed to the Mississippi Supreme Court. On September 28, 2023, the court reversed the trial court and rendered\njudgment in favor of the defendants.

Travel was severely\ndepressed during 2020, with reduced levels of new bookings. In 2021, we began to see a bookings recovery. In 2022, there was a strong, but uneven, recovery in\ntravel demand with different regions around the world experiencing different rates of recovery. In 2023, the overall reopening of the Asia-Pacific region and general\nrecovery outside of the United States was a factor in the gross bookings year-over-year growth rate for our B2B segment, but any other lingering impacts of the\npandemic did not have a significant impact on our businesses, and we expect that to remain the case for future periods.\nMore recently, inflation and other macroeconomic pressures in the U.S. and the global economy, such as rising interest rates, currency fluctuations and energy\nprice volatility, as well as evolving geopolitical conflicts, have contributed to an increasingly complex business environment. Our future operational results may be\nsubject to volatility, particularly in the short-term, due to the impact of the aforementioned trends. Broad, sustained negative economic impacts could put strain on\nour suppliers, business and service partners, which increases the risk of credit losses and service level or other disruptions.\nAdditionally, further health-related events, political instability, geopolitical conflicts, acts of terrorism, significant fluctuations in currency values, sustained\nlevels of increased inflation, sovereign debt issues, and natural disasters, are examples of other events that could have a negative impact on the travel industry in the\nfuture.\nDespite these factors, we have witnessed a healthy recovery of travel demand, which remains strong and is attributable to factors including pent-up demand\nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic, and consumers prioritizing spend on travel and experiences over other discretionary spending.\nFor additional information about our business strategy for Expedia Group, see the disclosure set forth in Part I. Item 1. Business, under the caption \u201cMarket\nOpportunity and Business Strategy.\u201d\nOnline Travel\nIncreased usage and familiarity with the internet have continued to drive rapid growth in online penetration of travel expenditures. Online penetration is higher\nin the U.S. and Western European markets with online penetration rates in some emerging markets, such as Latin America and Eastern European regions, lagging\nbehind those regions. Emerging markets continue to present an attractive growth opportunity for our business, while also attracting many competitors to online travel.\nThe industry is expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future. In addition to the growth of online travel agencies, we have seen continued interest\nin the online travel industry from search engine companies such as Google, evidenced by continued product enhancements, and prioritizing its own AdWords and\nmetasearch products such as Google Hotel Ads and Google Flights, in search results. Competitive entrants such as \u201cmetasearch\u201d companies, including Kayak.com\n(owned by Booking Holdings), trivago (in which Expedia Group owns a majority interest) as well as TripAdvisor, introduced differentiated features, pricing and\ncontent compared with the legacy online travel agency companies, as well as various forms of direct or assisted booking tools. Further, airlines and lodging\ncompanies are aggressively pursuing direct online distribution of their products and services. In addition, the increasing popularity of the \u201csharing economy,\u201d\naccelerated by online penetration, has had a direct impact on the travel and lodging industry. Businesses such as Airbnb, Vrbo and Booking.com have emerged as the\nleaders, bringing incremental alternative accommodation and vacation rental inventory to the market. Other competitors have arisen, including vacation rental\nproperty managers, who operate their own booking sites in addition to listing on Airbnb, Vrbo, and Booking.com, and are expected to continue to grow as a\npercentage of the global accommodations market. Additionally, traditional consumer ecommerce players have expanded their local offerings by adding hotel offers to\ntheir websites. Ride sharing app Uber has added transportation and experience offerings to its app via partnerships with other travel providers. Our B2B business has\ngrown significantly but faces competition from other OTAs with B2B offerings, as well as other competitors, such as independent B2B businesses.\nThe online travel industry also saw the development of alternative business models and variations in the timing of payment by travelers and to suppliers, which\nin some cases place pressure on historical business models. In particular, the agency hotel model saw rapid adoption in Europe.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5076, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8fb268d2-d15a-446a-805c-2d8ab8b61a84": {"__data__": {"id_": "8fb268d2-d15a-446a-805c-2d8ab8b61a84", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "be9d3ee3-8d8c-4e54-93f7-1d923467900f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "f9b88d945e8327065f18e4d0b0f471ef0c9ed70b7e21b67822ce55339e44ddb3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "112d937b-aee5-493d-b7f2-c938b7de9cf2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "ec844a9aca541c7f10ba06f82505f3fb2b906e8fb49e512cadcd4db85d8c457e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Other competitors have arisen, including vacation rental\nproperty managers, who operate their own booking sites in addition to listing on Airbnb, Vrbo, and Booking.com, and are expected to continue to grow as a\npercentage of the global accommodations market.

As a percentage of our total worldwide revenue in 2023, lodging accounted for 80%. Room\nnights booked grew 12% in 2023, as compared to a growth of 26% in 2022 and 71% in 2021. ADRs for rooms booked for Expedia Group increased 28% in 2021,\nincreased 3% in 2022 and decreased 2% in 2023. Over the last couple of years, our lodging business saw a significant increase in ADRs compared to pre-pandemic\nlevels, which were driven by broader industry trends, a mix shift to Vrbo and high ADR geographies.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our global lodging marketplace had over 3 million lodging properties available, including over 2 million online bookable alternative\naccommodations listings through Vrbo and over 940,000 hotels and alternative accommodations through our other brands.\nHotel. We generate the majority of our revenue through the facilitation of hotel reservations (stand-alone and package bookings). Our relationships and overall\neconomics with hotel supply partners have been broadly stable in recent years. As we continue to expand the breadth and depth of our global hotel offering, in some\ncases we have reduced our economics in various geographies based on local market conditions. These impacts are due to specific initiatives intended to drive greater\nglobal size and scale through faster overall room night growth. Additionally, increased promotional activities such as growing loyalty programs, discounting, and\ncouponing have contributed to declines in revenue per room night and profitability in certain cases.\nFurther, while the global lodging industry remains very fragmented, there has been consolidation in the hotel space among chains as well as ownership groups.\nIn the meantime, certain hotel chains have been focusing on driving direct bookings on their own websites and mobile applications by advertising lower rates than\nthose available on third-party websites as well as incentives such as loyalty programs, increased or exclusive product availability and complimentary benefits.\nAlternative Accommodations. Over the past decade, we expanded into the alternative accommodations market. Vrbo is a leader, specializing in unique whole\nhome inventory, primarily in North American leisure markets, and represents an attractive growth opportunity for Expedia Group.\nVrbo has transitioned from a listings-based classified advertising model to an online transactional model that optimizes for both travelers and homeowner and\nproperty manager partners, with a goal of increasing monetization and driving growth through investments in marketing as well as in product and technology. Vrbo\noffers hosts subscription-based listing or pay-per-booking service models. It also generates revenue from a traveler service fee for bookings, as well as insurance\nproducts.\nSince our hotel and alternative accommodation supplier agreements are generally negotiated on a percentage basis, any increase or decrease in ADRs has an\nimpact on the revenue we earn per room night. In the future, we could see macroeconomic factors influence ADR trends, including rising living costs due to inflation\nand higher interest rates. Other factors that could lead to moderating ADRs include growth in hotel supply and the increase in alternative accommodation inventory.\nAir\nSimilar to the rest of travel, the airlines experienced a surge in pent-up demand when COVID-19 restrictions were lifted, however they continued to operate at\nreduced capacity due to staffing shortages and supply chain disruptions. In 2023, airlines focused on adding capacity back to their networks, ending the year with\nglobal air capacity nearly recovered to 2019 levels. Despite the return of capacity in 2023, U.S. domestic airfares remained roughly flat year-over-year and up\napproximately 10% compared to 2019 levels, according to Airlines Report Corporation (\"ARC\") data. Our air bookings improved in 2023 compared to 2022, but\ncontinued to lag the growth in our lodging business.\nIn the future, we could encounter pressure on air remuneration as air carriers combine, certain supply agreements renew, and as we continue to add airlines to\nensure local coverage in new markets.\nBooked air tickets increased 4% in 2023, 8% in 2022 and 43% in 2021.

For example, traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest\nin the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring, summer and winter holiday travel. The number of bookings typically decreases in the fourth quarter.\nSince revenue for most of our travel services, including merchant and agency hotel, is recognized as the travel takes place rather than when it is booked, revenue\ntypically lags bookings by several weeks for our hotel business and can be several months or more for our alternative accommodations business. Historically, Vrbo\nhas seen seasonally stronger bookings in the first quarter of the year, with the relevant stays occurring during the peak summer travel months. The seasonal revenue\nimpact is exacerbated with respect to income by the nature of our variable cost of revenue and direct sales and marketing costs, which we typically realize in closer\nalignment to booking volumes, and the more stable nature of our fixed costs. As a result on a consolidated basis, revenue and income are typically the lowest in the\nfirst quarter and highest in the third quarter.\nThe growth in our B2B segment, international operations, advertising business or a change in our product mix, among others, may also influence the typical\ntrend of seasonality in the future.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCritical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because they\nrequire that we use judgment and estimates in applying those policies. We prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d). Preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires that\nwe make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the\nconsolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported. We base our estimates on historical experience, where applicable, and\nother assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThere are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We consider an\naccounting estimate to be critical if:\n\u2022It requires us to make an assumption because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were\nmaking the estimate; and\n\u2022Changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected may have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of\noperations.\nFor more information on each of these policies, see NOTE 2 \u2014 Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to consolidated financial statements. We discuss\ninformation about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates below.\nAccounting for Certain Merchant Revenue\nWe accrue the cost of certain merchant revenue based on the amount we expect to be billed by suppliers. In certain instances when a supplier invoices us for\nless than the cost we accrued, we generally reduce our merchant accounts payable and the supplier costs within net revenue six months in arrears, net of an\nallowance, when we determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier, based on historical experience. Actual revenue could be greater or less\nthan the amounts estimated due to changes in hotel billing practices or changes in traveler behavior.\nDeferred Loyalty Rewards\nWe currently offer certain internally administered traveler loyalty programs to our travelers. In July 2023, we began to unify and expand our existing loyalty\nprograms into one global rewards platform called One Key spanning all our main brands. One Key allows members to earn OneKeyCash, the currency of the One\nKey program, on eligible hotels, alternative accommodations, activities, packages car rentals, fights and cruises made on the U.S. points of sale on Expedia,\nHotels.com and Vrbo. Hotels.com Rewards continues to be offered outside of the United States and offers travelers one free night at any Hotels.com partner property\nafter that traveler stays 10 nights, subject to certain restrictions. Expedia Rewards also continues to be offered outside of the United States and enables participating\ntravelers to earn points on all hotel, flight, package and activities made on various international Brand Expedia websites. As travelers accumulate awards towards free\ntravel products, we defer the relative standalone selling price of earned awards, net of expected breakage, as deferred loyalty rewards within deferred merchant\nbookings on the consolidated balance sheet. In order to estimate the standalone selling price of the underlying services on which awards can be redeemed for all\nloyalty programs, we use an adjusted market assessment approach\n33", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5309, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ca5a7d31-84e0-4c22-b92b-870574901312": {"__data__": {"id_": "ca5a7d31-84e0-4c22-b92b-870574901312", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1421ba4b-da80-4a83-9740-714ea2f31a50", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "5f71fb96fff55758c3c20dd1ffaac03f599ff07d96b94704cc473ac3b62b96a5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2ad82a72-c7ea-4ee0-bd10-661ed53836f6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "73225b0aa154ef03bbc6b7b5b3cffd1bb9e3ef887cd8f417f1f3e81c7e604fed", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nand consider the redemption values expected from the traveler. We then estimate the number of rewards that will not be redeemed based on historical activity in our\nmembers' accounts as well as statistical modeling techniques. Revenue is recognized when we have satisfied our performance obligation relating to the awards, that\nis when the travel service purchased with the loyalty award is satisfied. Both the actual standalone selling price of the underlying services and ultimate redemption\nrates could differ materially from our estimates due to a number of factors, including fluctuations in reward value, product utilization and divergence from historical\nmember behavior.\nRecoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill. We assess goodwill for impairment annually as of October 1, or more frequently, if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have\noccurred. During the third quarter of 2023, as a result of trivago\u2019s recent strategic shift which included intensifying its brand marketing investments with an\nanticipated decrease in profitability, we concluded that sufficient indicators existed to require us to perform an interim impairment assessment. In the evaluation of\ngoodwill for impairment, we typically perform a quantitative assessment and compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value and, if applicable,\nrecord an impairment charge based on the excess of the reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value. Periodically, we may choose to perform a qualitative\nassessment, prior to performing the quantitative analysis, to determine whether the fair value of the goodwill is more likely than not impaired.\nWe generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting units on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market\nvaluation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the\nreporting units to generate in the future. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of\ngrowth and profitability of our business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of\nthe Company to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business. Our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar\ncompanies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating\nincome multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units.\nWe believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market approach is generally the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units\nbecause these are the most common valuation methodologies used within the travel and internet industries; and the blended use of both models compensates for the\ninherent risks associated with either model if used on a stand-alone basis.\nIn addition to measuring the fair value of our reporting units as described above, we consider the combined carrying and fair values of our reporting units in\nrelation to the Company\u2019s total fair value of equity plus debt as of the assessment date. Our equity value assumes our fully diluted market capitalization, using either\nthe stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date, plus an estimated acquisition premium which is based\non observable transactions of comparable companies. The debt value is based on the highest value expected to be paid to repurchase the debt, which can be fair\nvalue, principal or principal plus a premium depending on the terms of each debt instrument.\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets. We base our measurement of fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets, which primarily consist of trade name and\ntrademarks, using the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the\nobligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty\nrate and the weighted average cost of capital.\nIn addition to the trivago goodwill impairment charge mentioned above, as a result of the assessment during the third quarter of 2023, we recognized a\n$15 million impairment charge related to indefinite-lived trade name. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we also recognized intangible impairment charges of\n$114 million related to indefinite-lived trade names within our B2C segment.\nDefinite-Lived Intangible Assets.

Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant\nadverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the\nasset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the\nrecoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result\nfrom the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the\ncarrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation\n34", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4105, "end_char_idx": 5942, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0e68b7e8-d630-4a55-800f-7890e1c4e4a5": {"__data__": {"id_": "0e68b7e8-d630-4a55-800f-7890e1c4e4a5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5516eb5d-cae9-4452-b108-4d95c80b5d0b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "e7b44577c90b8ecea1a35fc97597a22e6a867d5d40227d7b4abc34c8c6860fae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f0abeb5d-b61d-4657-9220-5e92fc77d2aa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9fabe861ea06a5dcf7b143d033ad4d59d2411ffb3dbea9db92a311d84fb878d4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nmethodologies, which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary\ndifferences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes. We determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in\naccounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting. Accordingly, we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each\ntemporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense.\nWe consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience by\njurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, as well as other relevant factors. We may\nestablish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. Due to inherent complexities arising\nfrom the nature of our businesses, future changes in income tax law, tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results, we\nmake certain judgments and estimates. Therefore, actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates. All deferred income taxes are classified as long-\nterm on our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe account for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process of evaluating recognition and measurement criteria. The first step assesses whether the tax\nposition is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the tax authority, including resolution of any appeals or litigation, based on the technical merits\nof the position. If the tax position meets the more likely than not criteria, the portion of the tax benefit greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with the\ntax authority is recognized in the financial statements. The ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded.\nOther Long-Term Liabilities\nVarious Legal and Tax Contingencies. We record liabilities to address potential exposures related to business and tax positions we have taken that have been or\ncould be challenged by taxing authorities. In addition, we record liabilities associated with legal proceedings and lawsuits. These liabilities are recorded when the\nlikelihood of payment is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. The determination for required liabilities is based upon analysis of each individual\ntax issue, or legal proceeding, taking into consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments and the range of possible loss. In addition, our analysis may be based on\ndiscussions with outside legal counsel. The ultimate resolution of these potential tax exposures and legal proceedings may be greater or less than the liabilities\nrecorded.\nOccupancy and Other Taxes. Some states and localities impose taxes (e.g. transient occupancy, accommodation tax, sales tax and/or business privilege tax) on\nthe use or occupancy of hotel accommodations or other traveler services. Generally, hotels collect taxes based on the rate paid to the hotel and remit these taxes to the\nvarious tax authorities. When a customer books a room through one of our travel services, we collect a tax recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the\nhotel. We calculate the tax recovery charge by applying the applicable tax rate supplied to us by the hotels to the amount that the hotel has agreed to receive for the\nrental of the room by the consumer. In most jurisdictions, we do not collect or remit taxes, nor do we pay taxes to the hotel operator, on the portion of the customer\npayment we retain. Some jurisdictions have questioned our practice in this regard. While the applicable tax provisions vary among the jurisdictions, we generally\nbelieve that we are not required to pay such taxes. A limited number of taxing jurisdictions have made similar claims against certain of our companies for tax\namounts due on the rental amounts charged by owners of alternative accommodations properties or for taxes on our services.

Rather, we have obtained the\nadvice of international, state and local tax experts with respect to tax laws of certain countries, states and local jurisdictions that represent a large portion of our\nlodging revenue. Many of the statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the emergence of the internet and ecommerce. Certain\njurisdictions have enacted, and others may enact, legislation regarding the imposition of taxes on businesses that facilitate the booking of hotel or alternative\naccommodations. We continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under new and emerging laws and regulations. We\nwill continue to monitor the issue closely and provide additional disclosure, as well as adjust the level of reserves, as developments warrant. Additionally, certain of\nour businesses are involved in tax related litigation, which is discussed in Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of new accounting pronouncements, see NOTE 2 \u2014 Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nOccupancy and Other Taxes\nWe are currently involved in seven lawsuits brought by or against states, cities and counties over issues involving the payment of hotel occupancy and other\ntaxes. We continue to defend these lawsuits vigorously. With respect to the principal claims in these matters, we believe that the statutes and/or ordinances at issue do\nnot apply to us or the services we provide, namely the facilitation of travel planning and reservations, and, therefore, that we do not owe the taxes that are claimed to\nbe owed. We believe that the statutes and ordinances at issue generally impose occupancy and other taxes on entities that own, operate or control hotels (or similar\nbusinesses) or furnish or provide hotel rooms or similar accommodations.\nFor additional information and other recent developments on these and other legal proceedings, see Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings.\nWe have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other tax litigation, consistent with applicable accounting\nprinciples and in light of all current facts and circumstances, in the amount of $46 million as of December 31, 2023 and $44 million as of December 31, 2022.\nCertain jurisdictions, including without limitation the states of New York, New Jersey, North Carolina, Minnesota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Maryland,\nPennsylvania, Hawaii, Iowa, Massachusetts, Arizona, Wisconsin, Idaho, Arkansas, Indiana, Maine, Nebraska, Vermont, Mississippi, Virginia, the city of New York,\nand the District of Columbia, have enacted legislation seeking to tax online travel company services as part of sales or other taxes for hotel and/or other\naccommodations and/or car rental. In addition, in certain jurisdictions, we have entered into voluntary collection agreements pursuant to which we have agreed to\nvoluntarily collect and remit taxes to state and/or local taxing jurisdictions. We are currently remitting taxes to a number of jurisdictions, including without limitation\nthe states of New York, New Jersey, South Carolina, North Carolina, Minnesota, Georgia, Wyoming, West Virginia, Oregon, Rhode Island, Montana, Maryland,\nKentucky, Maine, Pennsylvania, Hawaii, Iowa, Massachusetts, Arizona, Wisconsin, Idaho, Arkansas, Indiana, Nebraska, Vermont, Colorado, Mississippi, Virginia,\nthe city of New York and the District of Columbia, as well as certain other jurisdictions.\nPay-to-Play\nCertain jurisdictions may assert that we are required to pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of the ordinances.\nThis prepayment of contested taxes is referred to as \u201cpay-to-play.\u201d Payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes and,\neven when such payments are made, we continue to defend our position vigorously. If we prevail in the litigation, for which a pay-to-play payment was made, the\njurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest. However, any significant pay-to-play payment or\nlitigation loss could negatively impact our liquidity.\nOther Jurisdictions.

Management believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results. This\nnon-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to\nGAAP. Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact of certain expenses to our consolidated statements of operations. We\nendeavor to compensate for the limitation of the non-GAAP measure presented by also providing the most directly comparable GAAP measure and a description of\nthe reconciling items and adjustments to derive the non-GAAP measure. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes certain items related to transactional tax matters, which\nmay ultimately be settled in cash, and we urge investors to review the detailed disclosure regarding these matters included above, in the Legal Proceedings section, as\nwell as the notes to the financial statements. The non-GAAP financial measure used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be\ncomparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Expedia Group, Inc. adjusted for (1) net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests;\n(2) provision for income taxes; (3) total other expenses, net; (4) stock-based compensation expense, including compensation expense related to certain subsidiary\nequity plans; (5) acquisition-related impacts, including (i) amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairment, (ii) gains (losses)\nrecognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements, if any, and (iii) upfront consideration paid to settle employee compensation plans of the\nacquiree, if any; (6) certain other items, including restructuring; (7) items included in legal reserves, occupancy tax and other; (8) that portion of gains (losses) on\nrevenue hedging activities that are included in other, net that relate to revenue recognized in the period; and (9) depreciation.\nThe above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are noncash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items\nis unpredictable, not driven by core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is a\nuseful measure for analysts and investors to evaluate our future on-going performance as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison of our performance and\nprojected cash earnings with our historical results from prior periods and to the results of our competitors. Moreover, our management uses this measure internally to\nevaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments. In addition, we believe that by excluding certain items, such as stock-\nbased compensation and acquisition-related impacts, Adjusted EBITDA corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business and\nallows investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting the ongoing cash earnings capabilities of our business, from which capital investments\nare made and debt is serviced.\nThe reconciliation of net income attributable to Expedia Group, Inc. to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:\nYear ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(In millions)\nNet income attributable to Expedia Group, Inc. $ 797 $ 352 $ 12 \nNet income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests (109) (9) 3 \nProvision for income taxes 330 195 (53)\nTotal other expense, net 15 547 224 \nOperating income 1,033 1,085 186 \nGain (loss) on revenue hedges related to revenue recognized (7) (6) (17)\nRestructuring and related reorganization charges \u2014 \u2014 55 \nLegal reserves, occupancy tax and other 8 23 1 \nStock-based compensation 413 374 418 \nDepreciation and amortization 807 792 814 \nImpairment of goodwill 297 \u2014 14 \nIntangible and other long-term asset impairment 129 81 6 \nAdjusted EBITDA $ 2,680 $ 2,349 $ 1,477 \n43", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4114, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9155c967-f6a4-4841-8c29-6a61dc19a13a": {"__data__": {"id_": "9155c967-f6a4-4841-8c29-6a61dc19a13a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "47", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8cf76948-4453-4451-8bc9-00462d92235d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "47", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "0a42ac3baab19f1b32218b21ab796f69584e9b43ff93dbab2807b7b601d0ea90", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dace9b4e-b05d-44e1-8edb-0dd363d797c7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e2375c6b0a79166b7baf4c41d5d5faaeba9cd0705e48029a70c5a060a16b627d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nFinancial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are typically cash flows generated from operations, cash available under our credit facility as well as our cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investment balances, which were $4.3 billion and $4.1 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022.

We pay our airline suppliers related to these merchant model bookings generally within a few weeks after completing the transaction. For most\nother merchant bookings, which is primarily our merchant lodging business, we generally pay after the travelers\u2019 use and, in some cases, subsequent billing from the\nhotel suppliers. Therefore, generally we receive cash from the traveler prior to paying our supplier, and this operating cycle represents a working capital source of\ncash to us. Typically, the seasonal fluctuations in our merchant hotel bookings have affected the timing of our annual cash flows. Generally, during the first half of the\nyear, hotel bookings have traditionally exceeded stays, resulting in much higher cash flow related to working capital.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nMarket Risk Management\nMarket risk is the potential loss from adverse changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and market prices. Our exposure to market risk includes our\nlong-term debt, our revolving credit facilities, derivative instruments and cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, intercompany receivables, investments,\nmerchant accounts payable and deferred merchant bookings denominated in foreign currencies. We manage our exposure to these risks through established policies\nand procedures. Our objective is to mitigate potential income statement, cash flow and market exposures from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAs of both December 31, 2023 and 2022, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our debt was $6.3 billion. The aggregate principal of our debt\nincluded:\n\u2022$1.044 billion of senior unsecured notes due May 2025 that bear interest at 6.25%;\n\u2022$750 million of senior unsecured notes due February 2026 that bear interest at 5.0%;\n\u2022$1 billion of convertible senior unsecured notes due February 2026 with a fixed rate of 0% (the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d);\n\u2022$750 million of senior unsecured notes due August 2027 that bear interest at 4.625%;\n\u2022$1 billion of senior unsecured notes due February 2028 that bear interest at 3.8%;\n\u2022$1.25 billion of senior unsecured notes due February 2030 that bear interest at 3.25%; and(1)\n(2)\n46", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3377, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a3870a96-be04-4ec9-95a9-49778e8bf4d3": {"__data__": {"id_": "a3870a96-be04-4ec9-95a9-49778e8bf4d3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8bd0a4ea-0a53-4015-af41-92c318a6533a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "7ad6503c6e923ecd0e79c3f51b051c34e3f78dd2d2669a5984006cd8317848ed", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c35f81dd-a934-47c0-b9b4-a6b4862c0bab", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "aa6c96ae537481c700adca41907f53f919ed73e9213c751e87e2433eacb65fa1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\n\u2022$500 million of senior unsecured notes due March 2031 that bear interest at 2.95%.\nThe 6.25%, 5.0%, 4.625%, 3.8%, 3.25%, and 2.95% senior unsecured notes are collectively the \u201cSenior Notes.\u201d If market interest rates decline, our required\npayments will exceed those based on market rates. Additionally, the 6.25%, 4.625% and 2.95% senior unsecured notes are subject to interest rate adjustments should\nour credit ratings be adjusted downwards, which would result in increased interest expense in the future. The total estimated fair value of our Senior Notes and\nConvertible Notes was approximately $6.1 billion and $5.8 billion as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The fair value was determined\nbased on quoted market prices in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. A 50 basis point increase or decrease in\ninterest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our debt by approximately $100 million.\nWe maintain a revolving credit facility of $2.5 billion, which bears interest based on market rates plus a spread determined by our credit ratings. Because our\ninterest rate is tied to a market rate, we will be susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates if, consistent with our practice to date, we do not hedge the interest rate\nexposure arising from any borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. We had no revolving credit facilities borrowings outstanding as of both December 31,\n2023 and 2022.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nWe conduct business in certain international markets, primarily in Australia, Canada, China, the United Kingdom, and the European Union. Because we\noperate in international markets, we have exposure to different economic climates, political arenas, tax systems and regulations that could affect foreign exchange\nrates. Our primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to transacting in foreign currency and recording the activity in U.S. dollars. Changes in exchange rates\nbetween the U.S. dollar and these other currencies will result in transaction gains or losses, which we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations.\nTo the extent practicable, we minimize our foreign currency exposures by maintaining natural hedges between our current assets and current liabilities in\nsimilarly denominated foreign currencies. Additionally, we use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures,\nforeign denominated liabilities related to certain of our loyalty programs and our other foreign currency-denominated operating liabilities. These instruments are\ntypically short-term and are recorded at fair value with gains and losses recorded in other, net. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had a net forward liability of\n$9 million recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and net forward asset of $15 million included in prepaid expenses and other current assets. We\nmay enter into additional foreign exchange derivative contracts or other economic hedges in the future. Our goal in managing our foreign exchange risk is to reduce\nto the extent practicable our potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on our earnings, cash flows and financial position. We make a number\nof estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases the level of future bookings, cancellations, refunds, customer stay patterns and payments in\nforeign currencies. In the event those estimates differ significantly from actual results, we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedges.\nIn March 2022, we entered into two fixed-to-fixed cross-currency interest rate swaps (\u201cthe swaps\u201d) with an aggregate notional amount of \u20ac300 million. The\nswaps were designated as net investment hedges of Euro assets with the objective to protect the U.S. dollar value of our net investments in the Euro foreign\noperations due to movements in foreign currency.

In our opinion, Expedia\nGroup, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO\ncriteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance\nsheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders\u2019 equity\nand cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated February 8, 2024 expressed an\nunqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required\nto be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance\nabout whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating\nthe design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the\ncircumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions\nand dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with\nauthorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the\npolicies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSeattle, Washington\nFebruary 8, 2024\n50", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4156, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "87eb47f1-6335-4ede-9809-8b656cd363b2": {"__data__": {"id_": "87eb47f1-6335-4ede-9809-8b656cd363b2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d479c153-c81b-48ff-924d-57c2ac89759b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "0a679ecf19c25f222f8883c37ef0de12812d91c2191561914958e9142fa3bd24", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nPart II.

Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Expedia Group, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Expedia Group, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated\nstatements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023,\nand the related notes(collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three\nyears in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 8, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements\nbased on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with\nthe U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance\nabout whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks\nof material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles\nused and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial\nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nLoyalty Programs\nDescription of the Matter As discussed in Note 2 of the financial statements, travelers enrolled in the One Key, Expedia Rewards and Hotels.com\nRewards loyalty programs (collectively \u201cloyalty programs\u201d) earn rewards with each eligible booking made which can be\nredeemed for free or discounted future bookings. Member consideration is allocated between travel services and rewards\nearned in the loyalty programs. The Company defers the relative standalone selling price of earned rewards, net of\nrewards not expected to be redeemed (known as \u201cbreakage\u201d), as deferred loyalty rewards within deferred merchant\nbookings on the consolidated balance sheet. To estimate the relative standalone selling price for rewards, the Company\nconsiders the stated redemption value per reward dictated by the terms of the loyalty programs and then estimates the\nfuture breakage of rewards based on statistical modeling techniques using historical member activity. The deferred loyalty\nrewards balance, net of amounts paid to the travel suppler, is recognized as revenue when the travel service purchased\nwith the loyalty reward is satisfied. \nF- 2", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4592, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "28530db4-bf4b-44d4-bb69-66dbd19752c3": {"__data__": {"id_": "28530db4-bf4b-44d4-bb69-66dbd19752c3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0aa305d4-55cc-4579-a9fe-9476a6c7521a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "101a3b45c6d38ed4249d1d4a0071e14f875b2a8b6d87e60ad46a59b3210c6256", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nAuditing the Company\u2019s deferred loyalty rewards balance is especially complex and judgmental due to significant\nmeasurement uncertainty in determining the expected future breakage of rewards. Management uses statistical modeling\ntechniques to estimate future breakage based on historical member activity. The amount of member consideration\nallocated to the rewards earned is sensitive to the expected future breakage assumption. The introduction of new\nprograms, changes in loyalty program terms or the method, or manner in which rewards can be redeemed by members can\nchange member behavior which increases the measurement uncertainty as historical member activity may not be\nindicative of future behavior.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in\nOur AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over Management\u2019s\nreview of the statistical modeling techniques and resulting breakage estimates. We also tested controls over the\ncompleteness and accuracy of member activity data used in the breakage estimate analyses. This included controls over\nthe Company\u2019s systems and the application controls involved in the process to track loyalty reward member activity.\nTo test the deferred loyalty rewards balance, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, involving our\nactuarial specialists to assist us in assessing the methods used by Management and to develop an independent actuarial\nestimate of a reasonable range of breakage rates. We then compared this reasonable range of breakage rates to the\nCompany\u2019s estimates. Additionally, we tested the completeness and accuracy of the member activity data used by our\nactuarial specialists in their breakage analyses.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2004.\nSeattle, Washington\nFebruary 8, 2024\nF- 3", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1865, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}",

1 \u2014 Organization and Basis of Presentation\nDescription of Business\nExpedia Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries provide travel products and services to leisure and corporate travelers in the United States and abroad as well as\nvarious media and advertising offerings to travel and non-travel advertisers. These travel products and services are offered through a diversified portfolio of brands\nincluding: Brand Expedia\u00ae, Hotels.com\u00ae, Expedia\u00ae Partner Solutions, Vrbo\u00ae, trivago\u00ae, Orbitz\u00ae, Travelocity\u00ae, Hotwire\u00ae, Wotif\u00ae, ebookers\u00ae, CheapTickets\u00ae,\nExpedia Group\u2122 Media Solutions, CarRentals.com\u2122 and Expedia Cruises. In addition, many of these brands have related international points of sale. We refer to\nExpedia Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries collectively as \u201cExpedia Group,\u201d the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cour\u201d in these consolidated financial statements.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include Expedia Group, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and entities we control, or in which we have\na variable interest and are the primary beneficiary of expected cash profits or losses. We record our investments in entities that we do not control, but over which we\nhave the ability to exercise significant influence, using the equity method or at fair value. We have eliminated significant intercompany transactions and accounts.\nWe believe that the assumptions underlying our consolidated financial statements are reasonable. However, these consolidated financial statements do not\npresent our future financial position, the results of our future operations and cash flows.\nSeasonality\nWe generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our travel services. For example, traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest\nin the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring, summer and winter holiday travel. The number of bookings typically decreases in the fourth quarter.\nSince revenue for most of our travel services, including merchant and agency hotel, is recognized as the travel takes place rather than when it is booked, revenue\ntypically lags bookings by several weeks for our hotel business and can be several months or more for our alternative accommodations business. Historically, Vrbo\nhas seen seasonally stronger bookings in the first quarter of the year, with the relevant stays occurring during the peak summer travel months. The seasonal revenue\nimpact is exacerbated with respect to income by the nature of our variable cost of revenue and direct sales and marketing costs, which we typically realize in closer\nalignment to booking volumes, and the more stable nature of our fixed costs. As a result on a consolidated basis, revenue and income are typically the lowest in the\nfirst quarter and highest in the third quarter.\nNOTE 2 \u2014 Significant Accounting Policies\nConsolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Expedia Group, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and entities for which we control a majority\nof the entity\u2019s outstanding common stock. We record non-controlling interest in our consolidated financial statements to recognize the minority ownership interest in\nour consolidated subsidiaries. Non-controlling interest in the earnings and losses of consolidated subsidiaries represent the share of net income or loss allocated to\nmembers or partners in our consolidated entities. trivago is a separately listed company on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and, therefore, is subject to its own\nreporting and filing requirements, which could result in possible differences that are not expected to be material to Expedia Group, Inc.\nWe have eliminated significant intercompany transactions and accounts in our consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting Estimates\nWe use estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d). Our estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as\nof the date of our consolidated financial statements. These estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amount of net income or loss during any period. Our\nactual financial results could differ significantly from these estimates. The significant estimates underlying our consolidated financial statements include revenue\nrecognition; recoverability of current and long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill; income and transactional taxes, such as potential settlements related to\noccupancy and excise taxes; loss contingencies; deferredTM\nF- 9", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4767, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1ff327ca-fab5-4135-9e7e-966b65ad488f": {"__data__": {"id_": "1ff327ca-fab5-4135-9e7e-966b65ad488f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "69", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c370189a-889e-4d01-a9a1-6fb6ca370fd1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "69", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "537c63c4e5daac4ef376533de850270b0373caa9316bbbe1b8181034943220d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nloyalty rewards; stock-based compensation; accounting for derivative instruments and provisions for credit losses, customer refunds and chargebacks.\nReclassifications\nWe have reclassified prior period financial statements to conform to the current period presentation.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue upon transfer of control of our promised services in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for\nthose services.\nFor our primary transaction-based revenue sources, discussed below, we have determined net presentation (that is, the amount billed to a traveler less the\namount paid to a supplier) is appropriate for the majority of our revenue transactions as the supplier is primarily responsible for providing the underlying travel\nservices and we do not control the service provided by the supplier to the traveler. We exclude all taxes assessed by a government authority, if any, from the\nmeasurement of transaction prices that are imposed on our travel related services or collected by the Company from customers (which are therefore excluded from\nrevenue).\nWe offer traditional travel services on a stand-alone and package basis generally either through the merchant or the agency business model.\nUnder the merchant model, we facilitate the booking of hotel rooms, alternative accommodations, airline seats, car rentals and destination services from our\ntravel suppliers and we are the merchant of record for such bookings.\nUnder the agency model, we pass reservations booked by the traveler to the relevant travel supplier and the travel supplier serves as the merchant of record for\nsuch bookings. We receive commissions or ticketing fees from the travel supplier and/or traveler. For certain agency airline, hotel and car transactions, we also\nreceive fees through global distribution systems (\u201cGDS\u201d) that provide the computer systems through which the travel supplier inventory is made available and\nthrough which reservations are booked.\nUnder the advertising model, we offer travel and non-travel advertisers access to a potential source of incremental traffic and transactions through our various\nmedia and advertising offerings on trivago and our transaction-based websites.\nIn addition, Vrbo also provides subscription-based listing and other ancillary services to property owners and managers.\nThe nature of our travel booking service performance obligations vary based on the travel service with differences primarily related to the degree to which we\nprovide post booking services to the traveler and the timing when rights and obligations are triggered in our underlying supplier agreements. We consider both the\ntraveler and travel supplier as our customers.\nRefer to NOTE 18 \u2014 Segment Information for revenue by business model and service type.\nLodging. Our lodging revenue is comprised of revenue recognized under the merchant, agency and Vrbo subscription-based listing services model.\nMerchant Hotel. We provide travelers access to book hotel room reservations through our contracts with lodging suppliers, which provide us with rates and\navailability information for rooms but for which we have no control over the rooms and do not bear inventory risk. Our travelers pay us for merchant hotel\ntransactions prior to departing on their trip, generally when they book the reservation. We record the payment in deferred merchant bookings until the stayed night\noccurs, at which point we recognize the revenue, net of amounts paid to suppliers, as this is when our performance obligation is satisfied. Payments to suppliers are\ngenerally due within 30 days of check-in or stay. In certain instances when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we accrued, we generally reduce our merchant\naccounts payable and the supplier costs within net revenue six months in arrears, net of an allowance, when we determine it is not probable that we will be required\nto pay the supplier, based on historical experience. Cancellation fees are collected and remitted to the supplier, if applicable.\nAgency Hotel. We generally record agency revenue from the hotel when the stayed night occurs as we provide post booking services to the traveler and, thus\nconsider the stay as when our performance obligation is satisfied. We record an allowance for cancellations on this revenue based on historical experience.\nMerchant and Agency Vrbo Alternative Accommodations. Vrbo's lodging revenue is generally earned on a pay-per-booking basis, which can be either merchant\nor agency bookings depending on the nature of the payment processor. Pay-per-booking arrangements are commission-based where rental property owners and\nmanagers bear the inventory risk, have latitude in setting the price and compensate Vrbo for facilitating bookings with travelers. Under pay-per-booking\narrangements, each booking is a separate contract as listings are typically cancelable at any time and the related revenue, net of amounts paid to property owners, is\nrecognized at check in, which is the point in time when our service to the traveler is complete.

The service fee charged to travelers provides compensation for Vrbo's services, including but not limited to the\nuse of Vrbo's website and a \u201cBook with Confidence Guarantee\u201d providing travelers with comprehensive payment protection and 24/7 traveler support. The\nperformance obligation is to facilitate the booking of a property and assist travelers up to their check in process and, as such, the traveler service fee revenue is\nrecognized at check-in.\nSubscription-based Listing Services. To a lesser extent, Vrbo's lodging revenue is also earned on a pay-per-subscription basis. In pay-per-subscription contracts,\nproperty owners or managers purchase in advance online advertising services related to the listing of their properties for rent over a fixed term (typically one year).\nAs the performance obligation is the listing service and is provided to the property owner or manager over the life of the listing period, the pay-per-subscription\nrevenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the listing period.\nMerchant and Agency Air. We record revenue on air transactions when the traveler books the transaction, as we do not typically provide significant post\nbooking services to the traveler and payments due to and from air carriers are typically due at the time of ticketing. We record a reserve for chargebacks and\ncancellations at the time of the transaction based on historical experience. In certain transactions, the GDS collects commissions from our suppliers and passes these\ncommissions to us, net of their fees. Therefore, we view payments through the GDS as commissions from suppliers and record these commissions in net revenue.\nFees paid to the GDS as compensation for their role in processing transactions are recorded as cost of revenue.\nAdvertising and Media. We record revenue from click-through fees charged to our travel partners for leads sent to the travel partners\u2019 websites. We record\nrevenue from click-through fees after the traveler makes the click-through to the related travel partners\u2019 websites. We record revenue for advertising placements\nratably over the advertising period or upon delivery of advertising impressions, depending on the terms of the contract. Payments from advertisers are generally due\nwithin 30 days of invoicing.\nOther. Other primarily includes transaction revenue for booking services related to products such as car, cruise and destination services under the agency\nbusiness model. We generally record the related revenue when the travel occurs, as in most cases we provide post booking services and this is when our performance\nobligation is complete. Additionally, no rights or obligations are triggered in our supplier agreements until the travel occurs. We record an allowance for cancellations\non this revenue based on historical experience. Revenue from other ancillary alternative accommodation services or products are recorded either upon delivery or\nwhen we provide the service. In addition, other also includes travel insurance products primarily under the merchant model, for which revenue is recorded at the time\nthe transaction is booked.\nPackages. Packages assembled by travelers through the packaging functionality on our websites generally include a merchant hotel component and some\ncombination of an air, car or destination services component. The individual package components are accounted for as separate performance obligations and\nrecognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policies stated above.\nPrepaid Merchant Bookings. We classify payments made to suppliers in advance of Vrbo performance obligations as prepaid merchant bookings included\nwithin prepaid and other current assets. Prepaid merchant bookings was $365 million as of December 31, 2023 and $480 million as of December 31, 2022.\nDeferred Merchant Bookings. We classify cash payments received in advance of our performance obligations as deferred merchant bookings. At December 31,\n2022, $6.2 billion of advance cash payments was reported within deferred merchant bookings, $5.3 billion of which was recognized resulting in $871 million of\nrevenue during the year ended December 31, 2023 with the remainder primarily consisting of cancellations during the year. At December 31, 2023, the related\nbalance was $6.9 billion.\nTravelers enrolled in our internally administered traveler loyalty rewards programs earn rewards for each eligible booking made which can be redeemed for\nfree or discounted future bookings.

We have used the portfolio approach to account for our loyalty points as the rewards programs share similar\ncharacteristics within each program in relation to the value provided to the traveler and their breakage patterns. Using this portfolio approach is not expected to differ\nmaterially from applying the guidance to individual contracts. However, we will continue to assess and refine, if necessary, how a portfolio within each rewards\nprogram is defined.\nWe do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for\nwhich we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.\nCash, Restricted Cash, and Cash Equivalents\nOur cash and cash equivalents include cash and liquid financial instruments, including money market funds and term deposit investments, with maturities of\nthree months or less when purchased. Restricted cash includes cash and cash equivalents that is restricted through legal contracts, regulations or our intention to use\nthe cash for a specific purpose. Our restricted cash primarily relates to certain traveler deposits and to a lesser extent collateral for office leases.

Investments, other than minority equity investments, classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses\nrecorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (\"OCI\"). Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale investments,\nif any, are determined on a specific identification basis. Investments with remaining maturities of less than one year are classified within short-term investments. All\nother investments are classified within long-term investments and other assets.\nMinority equity investments with either readily determinable fair values, or for which we have elected to apply the fair value option, are measured at fair value\non a recurring basis with changes in fair value recorded through net income or loss. Minority investments without readily determinable fair values, for which we have\nnot elected to measure at fair value, are measured using the equity method, or measured at cost with observable price changes reflected through net income or loss.\nWe perform a qualitative assessment on a quarterly basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less\nthan carrying value. Changes in value of minority equity investments are recorded in other income (expense), net.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are generally due within thirty days and are recorded net of an allowance for expected uncollectible amounts. We consider accounts\noutstanding longer than the contractual payment terms as past due. The risk characteristics we generally review when analyzing our accounts receivable pools\nprimarily include the type of receivable (for example, credit card vs hotel collect), collection terms and historical or expected credit loss patterns. For each pool, we\nmake estimates of expected credit losses for our allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due,\nprevious loss history continually updated for new collections data, the credit quality of our customers, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable\nforecasts of future economic conditions and other factors that may affect our ability to collect from customers.

We capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage related to the development of internal use software. We\nexpense costs incurred related to the planning and post-implementation phases of development as incurred.\nWe compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which is three to five years for computer equipment,\ncapitalized software development and furniture and other equipment, 15 years for land improvements, and 40 years for buildings, which includes our corporate\nheadquarters. Land is not depreciated. We amortize leasehold improvement using the straight-line method, over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the\nimprovement or the remaining term of the lease.\nWe establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to return certain of our leased facilities to their original condition under the\nauthoritative accounting guidance for asset retirement obligations. Such assets are depreciated over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded\nliabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated restoration costs.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are primarily for office space and data centers and are included in operating lease right-\nof-use (\"ROU\") assets, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. ROU assets represent our\nright to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU\nassets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an\nimplicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.\nThe operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the\nlease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nFor operating leases with a term of one year or less, we have elected to not recognize a lease liability or ROU asset on our consolidated balance sheet. Instead,\nwe recognize the lease payments as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Short-term lease costs are immaterial to our consolidated statements of\noperations and cash flows.\nWe have office space and data center lease agreements with insignificant non-lease components and have elected the practical expedient to combine and\naccount for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe assign the value of the consideration transferred to acquire a business to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is\nallocated to goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions,\nespecially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from\ncustomer relationships and trade names, and discount rates. Management\u2019s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which\nare inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Any changes to provisional amounts identified during the\nmeasurement period are recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.\nRecoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is assigned to reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination as of the acquisition date. We assess\ngoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, neither of which is amortized, for impairment annually as of October 1, or more frequently, if events and\ncircumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. In the evaluation of goodwill for impairment, we typically perform a quantitative assessment and compare the\nfair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value. An impairment charge is recorded based on the excess of the reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value.\nPeriodically, we may choose to perform a qualitative assessment, prior to performing the quantitative analysis, to determine whether the fair value of the goodwill is\nmore likely than not impaired.\nWe generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting units on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market\nvaluation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the\nreporting units to generate in the future.

The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the Company to comparable publicly traded firms in\nsimilar lines of business. Our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as\nsize, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the\nreporting units.\nWe believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because\nthese are the most common valuation methodologies used within the travel and internet industries; and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent\nrisks associated with either model if used on a stand-alone basis.\nIn addition to measuring the fair value of our reporting units as described above, we consider the combined carrying and fair values of our reporting units in\nrelation to the Company\u2019s total fair value of equity plus debt as of the assessment date. Our equity value assumes our fully diluted market capitalization, using either\nthe stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date, plus an estimated acquisition premium which is based\non observable transactions of comparable companies. The debt value is based on the highest value expected to be paid to repurchase the debt, which can be fair\nvalue, principal or principal plus a premium depending on the terms of each debt instrument.\nIn our evaluation of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, we typically first perform a quantitative assessment and an impairment charge is recorded for the\nexcess of the carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets over their fair value, if necessary. We base our measurement of fair value of indefinite-lived\nintangible assets, which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks, using the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that the trade name and\ntrademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. As with goodwill, periodically,\nwe may choose to perform a qualitative assessment, prior to performing the quantitative analysis, to determine whether the fair value of the indefinite-lived\nintangible asset is more likely than not impaired.\nRecoverability of Intangible Assets with Definite Lives and Other Long-Lived Assets\nIntangible assets with definite lives and other long-lived assets are carried at cost and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of\none to ten years. We review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups, including property and equipment, to be used in operations whenever events or\nchanges in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a\nsignificant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the\nvalue of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the\nrecoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result\nfrom the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the\ncarrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would\ntypically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its\nestimated fair value.\nAssets held for sale, to the extent we have any, are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell.\nIncome Taxes\nWe record income taxes under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary\ndifferences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes.

Accrued\ninterest and penalties are included in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.\nIn relation to tax effects for accumulated OCI, our policy is to release the tax effects of amounts reclassified from accumulated OCI to pre-tax income (loss)\nfrom continuing operations. Any remaining tax effect in accumulated OCI is released following a portfolio approach.\nWe account for the global intangible low-tax income earned by our foreign subsidiaries included in gross U.S. taxable income in the period incurred.\nDerivative Instruments\nDerivative instruments are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. The fair values of the derivative financial instruments generally represent\nthe estimated amounts we would expect to receive or pay upon termination of the contracts as of the reporting date.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, our derivative instruments primarily consisted of foreign currency forward contracts. We use foreign currency forward\ncontracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures, foreign denominated liabilities related to certain of our loyalty programs and our other foreign\ncurrency-denominated operating liabilities. Our goal in managing our foreign exchange risk is to reduce, to the extent practicable, our potential exposure to the\nchanges that exchange rates might have on our earnings, cash flows and financial position. Our foreign currency forward contracts are typically short-term and, as\nthey do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, we classify the changes in their fair value in other, net and present associated cash flows within investing\nactivities on the statement of cash flows. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.\nUntil their redemption in March 2022, the aggregate principal value of our \u20ac650 million of registered senior unsecured notes that bore interest at 2.5% (the\n\u201c2.5% Notes\u201d) was designated as a hedge of our net investment in certain Euro-functional currency subsidiaries. In March 2022, we redeemed the 2.5% Notes and\nterminated the related hedging relationship. The currency translation adjustment amounts associated with the net investment hedge of the 2.5% Notes will remain in\naccumulated OCI until realized upon a full or partial sale or liquidation of applicable Euro-functional currency subsidiaries.\nIn March 2022, we entered into two fixed-to-fixed cross-currency interest rate swaps (the \u201cswaps\u201d) with an aggregate notional amount of \u20ac300 million. During\nthe term of each contract, we receive interest payments in U.S. dollars at a fixed rate of 5% and make interest payments in Euros at an average fixed rate of 3.38%\nbased on a notional amount and fixed interest rates determined at contract inception. The swaps were designated as a hedge of our net investment in certain Euro\nfunctional currency subsidiaries. Hedge effectiveness is assessed each quarter based on the net investment in the foreign subsidiaries designated as the hedged item\nand the changes in the fair value of the designated interest rate swaps based on spot rates. For hedges that meet the effectiveness requirements, changes in fair value\nare recorded as accumulated OCI within the foreign currency translation adjustment. Amounts excluded from hedge effectiveness at inception are recognized as\ninterest accrues within interest expense. The maturity date of both swaps is February 2026, whereby, we will receive U.S. dollars from and pay Euros to the contract\ncounterparties.\nForeign Currency Translation and Transaction Gains and Losses\nCertain of our operations outside of the United States use the related local currency as their functional currency. We translate revenue and expense at average\nrates of exchange during the period. We translate assets and liabilities at the rates of exchange as of the consolidated balance sheet dates and include foreign currency\ntranslation gains and losses as a component of accumulated OCI. Due to the nature of our operations and our corporate structure, we also have subsidiaries that have\nsignificant transactions in foreign currencies other than their functional currency. We record transaction gains and losses in our consolidated statements of operations\nrelated to the recurring remeasurement and settlement of such transactions.\nTo the extent practicable, we attempt to minimize this exposure by maintaining natural hedges between our current assets and current liabilities of similarly\ndenominated foreign currencies. Additionally, as discussed above, we use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue\nexposures and in lieu of holding certain foreign currency cash for the purpose of economically hedging our foreign currency-denominated operating liabilities.\nF- 15", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5142, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6101ac3e-0dad-4466-8aca-161a8eade434": {"__data__": {"id_": "6101ac3e-0dad-4466-8aca-161a8eade434", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "75", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "23fcf22d-dddd-4106-85e9-239425a72d86", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "75", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "667a4cca4736d351dac93c2b221e4ad4724006570fe629d07870876cdf97209b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b5fc0f7f-e74c-40cd-923f-ea7a5505fff0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "60e7bbdaaabb296833f7e2cc488a1cd9f49c176c3e38c50cca14472beb6fd815", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nDebt Issuance Costs\nWe defer costs we incur to issue debt, which are presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability, and\namortize these costs to interest expense over the term of the debt or in circumstances where the debt can be redeemed at the option of the holders, over the term of the\nredemption option.\nMarketing Promotions\nWe periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage booking of travel products and services. Generally, our incentive offers are as follows:\nCurrent Discount Offers. These promotions include dollar or percent off discounts to be applied against current purchases. We record the discounts as reduction\nin revenue at the date we record the corresponding revenue transaction.\nInducement Offers. These promotions include discounts granted at the time of a current purchase to be applied against a future qualifying purchase. We treat\ninducement offers as a reduction to revenue based on estimated future redemption rates.

These promotions include discounts to be applied against a future purchase to maintain customer satisfaction. Upon issuance, we record\nthese concession offers as a reduction to revenue based on estimated future redemption rates. We estimate our redemption rates using our historical experience for\nconcession offers.\nAdvertising Expense\nWe incur advertising expense consisting of offline costs, including television and print advertising, and online advertising expense to promote our brands. We\nexpense the production costs associated with advertisements in the period in which the advertisement first takes place. We expense the costs of communicating the\nadvertisement (e.g., television airtime) as incurred each time the advertisement is shown. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, our advertising\nexpense was $3.8 billion, $3.9 billion and $2.7 billion.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure and amortize the fair value of restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) and stock options as follows:\nRestricted Stock Units. RSUs are stock awards that are granted to employees entitling the holder to shares of common stock as the award vests, typically over a\nfour-year period, but may accelerate in certain circumstances. We measure the value of RSUs at fair value based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price\nof our common stock at the date of grant. We amortize the fair value, net of actual forfeitures, as stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term generally\non a straight-line basis, but at least equal to the portion of the grant-date fair value of the award that is vested at that date. In addition, we have a limited number of\nperformance stock units (\"PSUs\"), for which we calculate the fair value using a Monte Carlo valuation model and amortized the fair value, net of actual forfeitures,\nas stock-based compensation over the vesting term, generally a two or three year period, on an accelerated basis. The number of shares that ultimately vest depends\non achieving certain performance metrics or performance goals, as applicable, by the end of the performance period, assuming there is no accelerated vesting for,\namong other things, a termination of employment under certain circumstances. We record RSUs that may be settled by the holder in cash, rather than shares, as a\nliability and we remeasure these instruments at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Upon settlement of these awards, our total compensation expense\nrecorded over the vesting period of the awards will equal the settlement amount, which is based on our stock price on the settlement date.\nStock Options. Our employee stock options consist of service based awards. We measure the value of stock options issued or modified, including unvested\noptions assumed in acquisitions, on the grant date (or modification or acquisition dates, if applicable) at fair value, using appropriate valuation techniques, including\nthe Black-Scholes. We amortize the fair value, net of actual forfeitures, over the remaining explicit vesting term in the case of service-based awards and the longer of\nthe derived service period or the explicit service period for awards with market conditions on a straight-line basis. In addition, we classify certain employee option\nawards as liabilities when we deem it not probable that the employees holding the awards will bear the risk and rewards of stock ownership for a reasonable period of\ntime. Such options are revalued at the end of each reporting period and upon settlement our total compensation expense recorded from grant date to settlement date\nwill equal the settlement amount.

The accounts receivable are short-term in nature and are generally settled shortly after the sale.\nWe disclose the fair value of our financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy using the following three categories:\nLevel 1 \u2014 Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 \u2014 Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active\nmarkets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by\nobservable market data.\nLevel 3 \u2014 Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting the Company\u2019s own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by\nother market participants. These valuations require significant judgment.\nCertain Risks and Concentrations\nOur business is subject to certain risks and concentrations including dependence on relationships with travel suppliers, primarily airlines and hotels,\ndependence on third-party technology providers, exposure to risks associated with online commerce security and payment related fraud. We also rely on global\ndistribution system partners and third-party service providers for certain fulfillment services.\nFinancial instruments, which potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. We maintain some cash and\ncash equivalents balances with financial institutions that are in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. Our cash and cash equivalents are\nprimarily composed of term deposits as well as bank (both interest and non-interest bearing) account balances denominated in U.S. dollars, Euros, British pound,\nCanadian dollar, Australian dollar, Brazilian real, Indian Rupee, South Korean Won and Japanese Yen.\nContingent Liabilities\nWe have a number of regulatory and legal matters outstanding, as discussed further in NOTE 15 \u2014 Commitments and Contingencies. Periodically, we review\nthe status of all significant outstanding matters to assess the potential financial exposure. When (i) it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been\nincurred and (ii) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record the estimated loss in our consolidated statements of operations. We provide disclosure\nin the notes to the consolidated financial statements for loss contingencies that do not meet both of these conditions if there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may\nhave been incurred that would be material to the financial statements. Significant judgment is required to determine the probability that a liability has been incurred\nand whether such liability is reasonably estimable. We base accruals made on the best information available at the time which can be highly subjective. The final\noutcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nOccupancy and Other Taxes\nSome states and localities impose taxes (e.g. transient occupancy, accommodation tax, sales tax, and/or business privilege tax) on the use or occupancy of hotel\naccommodations or other traveler services. Generally, hotels collect taxes based on the room rate paid to the hotel and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities.\nWhen a customer books a room through one of our travel services, we collect a tax recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the hotel. We calculate the\ntax recovery charge by applying the applicable tax rate supplied to us by the hotels to the amount that the hotel has agreed to receive for the rental of the room by the\nconsumer. In most jurisdictions, we do not collect or remit taxes, nor do we pay taxes to the hotel operator on the portion of the customer payment we retain. Some\njurisdictions have questioned our practice in this regard. While the applicable tax provisions vary among the jurisdictions, we generally believe that we are not\nrequired to collect and\nF- 17", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5063, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "059f14f8-27cd-47ed-becb-91501140a276": {"__data__": {"id_": "059f14f8-27cd-47ed-becb-91501140a276", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "77", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cc322cb4-bb50-49fa-a5a4-be8a1d4cb43b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "77", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "19ff4e514688a5609972d1386943891c2d6de6504cb55ce1a859124a24478361", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nremit such taxes.

The new guidance requires acquiring entities to apply Topic 606 to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities\nin a business combination as compared to current GAAP where an acquirer generally recognizes such items at fair value on the acquisition date. The adoption of this\nnew guidance had no impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Policies Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued new guidance that modifies the disclosure and presentation requirements of\nreportable segments. The new guidance requires the disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker\n(\"CODM\") and included within each reported measure of segment profit and loss. In addition, the new guidance enhances interim disclosure requirements, clarifies\ncircumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss, provides new segment disclosure requirements for entities with a single\nreportable segment, and contains other disclosure requirements. The update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods\nwithin fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance\non our consolidated financial statement disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued new guidance to improve its income tax disclosure requirements.

As a result of this exchange, as of the third quarter of 2023, we reclassified our investment from Level 2 to a Level 1 asset.

Such fair value measurements are\nbased predominately on Level 3 inputs. We measure our minority investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment, adjusted by\nobservable price changes with changes recorded within other, net on our consolidated statements of operations.\nGoodwill. During 2023, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $297 million related to our trivago segment. This impairment charge resulted from\ntrivago\u2019s recent strategic shift which included intensifying its brand marketing investments with an anticipated decrease in profitability. As a result, we concluded that\nsufficient indicators existed that to require us to perform an interim quantitative assessment of goodwill for our trivago segment as of September 30, 2023, in which\nwe compared the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. The fair value estimate for the reporting unit was based on a blended analysis of the present\nvalue of future discounted cash flows and market value approach, Level 3 inputs. The significant estimates used in the discounted cash flows model included our\nweighted average cost of capital, projected cash flows and the long-term rate of growth. Our assumptions were based on the actual historical performance of the\nreporting unit and considered the weakening of operating results, and implied risk premiums based on market prices of our equity and debt as of the assessment date.\nOur significant estimates in the market approach model included identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability,\nrisk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and earnings multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. The excess of the reporting\nunit's carrying value over our estimate of the fair value was recorded as the goodwill impairment charge in third quarter of 2023. As of December 31, 2023, our\ntrivago segment had no goodwill remaining.\nAs noted above, trivago is subject to its own reporting and filing requirements and, therefore, assesses goodwill at a lower level, which could result in possible\ndifferences in the ultimate amount or timing of impairments recognized. Additionally, as the stock of our trivago segment is publicly traded, it is difficult to predict\nmarket dynamics and the extent or duration of any stock declines.\nDuring 2021, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $14 million in our B2B segment resulting from valuing a component of our Egencia reporting\nunit that remained after the sale on November 1, 2021.\nIntangible and Long-term Assets. During 2023, we recognized intangible asset impairment charges of $129 million related to indefinite-lived trade names that\nresulted from changes in estimated future revenues of the related brands, of which $114 million related to our B2C segment and $15 million related to our trivago\nsegment. The indefinite-lived intangible assets, classified as Level 3 measurements, were valued using the relief-from-royalty method, which includes unobservable\ninputs, including projected revenues and royalty rates, which ranged from 3% to 4% with a weighted average royalty rate of 3.2%.\nDuring 2022, we recognized intangible impairment charges of $81 million related to an indefinite-lived trade name within our trivago segment that resulted\nfrom changes in the weighted average cost of capital.

Our 2023 Share Repurchase Program does not have fixed expiration dates and does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of\nshares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing, manner, price and amount of any\nrepurchases will be subject to the discretion of the Company and depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of Expedia Group\u2019s common stock,\ngeneral market and economic conditions, regulatory requirements and other business considerations.\nShares repurchased under the authorized programs were as follows:\n Year Ended December 31,\n 2023 2022 2021\nNumber of shares repurchased 19.1 million 5.2 million \u2014\nAverage price per share $ 106.07 $ 96.09 $ \u2014 \nTotal cost of repurchases (in millions) $ 2,031 $ 500 $ \u2014 \n___________________________________\n(1) Amount excludes transaction costs and the excise tax due under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2023, $4.8 billion remains authorized for repurchase with no fixed termination date for the repurchases. Subsequent to the end of 2023, we\nrepurchased an additional 1.3 million shares for a total cost of $189 million, excluding transaction costs and excise tax, representing an average of $149.65 per share.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nThe balance of accumulated OCI as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments. These translation adjustments\ninclude foreign currency transaction gains at December 31, 2023 and 2022 of $6 million ($8 million before tax) and $16 million ($21 million before tax) associated\nwith our cross-currency interest rate swaps. Additionally, translation adjustments include foreign currency transaction losses of $7 million ($10 million before tax) as\nof both December 31, 2023 and 2022 associated with previously settled Euro-denominated notes that were designated as net investment hedges.

In periods when we recognize a net loss, such as the year ended December 31, 2021, we exclude the\nimpact of outstanding stock-based awards, common stock warrants and the potential share settlement impact related to our Convertible Notes from the diluted loss\nper share calculation as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect.\nThe following table presents our basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share:\n Year Ended December 31,\n 2023 2022 2021\n (In millions, except share and per share data)\nNet income attributable to Expedia Group, Inc. $ 797 $ 352 $ 12 \nPreferred stock dividend \u2014 \u2014 (67)\nLoss on redemption of preferred stock \u2014 \u2014 (214)\nNet income (loss) attributable to Expedia Group, Inc. common stockholders$ 797 $ 352 $ (269)\nEarnings (loss) per share attributable to Expedia Group, Inc. available to\ncommon stockholders:\nBasic $ 5.50 $ 2.24 $ (1.80)\nDiluted 5.31 2.17 (1.80)\nWeighted average number of shares outstanding (000's):\nBasic 144,967 156,672 149,734 \nDilutive effect of:\nConvertible Notes 3,921 3,921 \u2014 \nStock-based awards 1,333 1,153 \u2014 \nOther dilutive securities 7 5 \u2014 \nDiluted 150,228 161,751 149,734 \nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, approximately 4 million and approximately 9 million of outstanding stock-based awards have been excluded\nfrom the calculations of diluted earnings per share attributable to common stockholders because their effect would have been antidilutive.

The authorities also require that a portion of the total amount of\npackaged travel sold be bonded. Our guarantees also include certain surety bonds related to various company performance obligations. \nOur LOCs consist of stand-by LOCs, underwritten by a group of lenders, which we primarily issue for certain regulatory purposes as well as to certain hotel\nproperties to secure our payment for hotel room transactions. The contractual expiration dates of these LOCs are shown in the table above. There were no material\nclaims made against any stand-by LOCs during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nLegal Proceedings\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are a party to various lawsuits. Management does not expect these lawsuits to have a material impact on the liquidity,\nresults of operations, or financial condition of Expedia Group. We also evaluate other potential contingent matters, including value-added tax, excise tax, sales tax,\ntransient occupancy or accommodation tax and similar matters. We do not believe that the aggregate amount of liability that could be reasonably possible with\nrespect to these matters would have a material adverse effect on our financial results; however, litigation is inherently uncertain and the actual losses incurred in the\nevent that our legal proceedings were to result in unfavorable outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nLitigation Relating to Occupancy Taxes. One hundred three lawsuits have been filed by or against cities, counties and states involving hotel occupancy and\nother taxes. Seven lawsuits are currently active. These lawsuits are in various stages and we continue to defend against the claims made in them vigorously. With\nrespect to the principal claims in these matters, we believe that the statutes or ordinances at issue do not apply to us or the services we provide and, therefore, that we\ndo not owe the taxes that are claimed to be owed.

To date, fifty of these\nlawsuits have been dismissed. Some of these dismissals have been without prejudice and, generally, allow the governmental entity or entities to seek administrative\nremedies prior to pursuing further litigation. Thirty-five dismissals were based on a finding that we and the other defendants were not subject to the local tax\nordinance or that the local government lacked standing to pursue its claims. As a result of this litigation and other attempts by certain jurisdictions to levy such taxes,\nwe have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other taxes, consistent with applicable accounting principles and in\nlight of all current facts and circumstances, in the amount of $46 million and $44 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Our settlement reserve is based on our\nbest estimate of probable losses and the ultimate resolution of these contingencies may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded. An estimate for a reasonably\npossible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount reserved cannot be made. Changes to the settlement reserve are included within legal reserves, occupancy tax\nand other in the consolidated statements of operations.\nPay-to-Play. Certain jurisdictions may assert that we are required to pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of the\nordinances. This prepayment of contested taxes is referred to as \u201cpay-to-play.\u201d Payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such\ntaxes and, even when such payments are made, we continue to defend our position vigorously. If we prevail in the litigation, for which a pay-to-play payment was\nmade, the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest.\nWe are in various stages of inquiry or audit with various tax authorities, some of which, including in the City of Los Angeles regarding hotel occupancy taxes,\nmay impose a pay-to-play requirement to challenge an adverse inquiry or audit result in court.\nMatters Relating to International VAT. We are in various stages of inquiry or audit in multiple European Union jurisdictions regarding the application of VAT\nto our European Union related transactions. While we believe we comply with applicable VAT laws, rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, the tax\nauthorities may determine that we owe additional taxes. In certain jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, we may be required to \u201cpay-to-play\u201d any VAT\nassessment prior to contesting its validity. While we believe that we will be successful based on the merits of our positions with regard to audits in pay-to-play\njurisdictions, it is nevertheless reasonably possible that we could be required to pay any assessed amounts in order to contest or litigate the applicability of any\nassessments and an estimate for a reasonably possible amount of any such payments cannot be made.\nCompetition and Consumer Matters. On August 23, 2018, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, or \"ACCC\", instituted proceedings in the\nAustralian Federal Court against trivago. The ACCC alleged breaches of Australian Consumer Law, or \"ACL,\" relating to trivago\u2019s advertisements in Australia\nconcerning the hotel prices available on trivago\u2019s Australian site, trivago\u2019s strike-through pricing practice and other aspects of the way offers for accommodation\nwere displayed on trivago's Australian website. On January 20, 2020, the Australian Federal Court issued a judgment finding trivago had engaged in conduct in\nbreach of the ACL. On October 18 and 19, 2021, the court heard submissions from the parties regarding penalties and other orders. On April 22, 2022, the Australian\nFederal Court issued a judgment ordering trivago to pay a penalty of AU$44.7 million, which was paid in the second quarter of 2022, and to cover the ACCC\u2019s costs\narising from the proceedings. The court also enjoined trivago from engaging in misleading conduct of the type found by the Australian Federal Court to be in\ncontravention of the ACL. We recorded an estimated loss of approximately $11 million with respect to these proceedings in a previous period and an additional loss\nof approximately $23 million during the first quarter of 2022, for a total of approximately $34 million previously included in accrued expenses and other current\nliabilities as of March 31, 2022.\nNOTE 16 \u2013 Divestitures\nOn November 1, 2021, we completed the sale of Egencia, Expedia Group\u2019s corporate travel arm included within our B2B segment, to GBT.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4789, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dd4eb582-8fc3-43fe-bf49-294ee383203d": {"__data__": {"id_": "dd4eb582-8fc3-43fe-bf49-294ee383203d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "94", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4bfcf6d4-5f0f-47bc-8f88-e193b73a98ae", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "94", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "f49532f418980059dcb933e86222656878b5ad9abfbcd945389edb773615a0fe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "14e99ca4-3782-45c4-b71c-275a57cacba5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "94", "file_name": "expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/expedia_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1096431, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "d8abb4d34c525a666022a9aee811d117147644099978acb6891085e94523c3bd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The court also enjoined trivago from engaging in misleading conduct of the type found by the Australian Federal Court to be in\ncontravention of the ACL.

At December 31,\n2023, each of Expedia Group and IAC has a 50% ownership interest in two aircraft that may be used by both companies. Members of the aircraft flight crews are\nemployed by an entity in which the Company and IAC each have a 50% ownership interest. The Company and IAC have agreed to share costs relating to flight crew\ncompensation and benefits pro-rata according to each company\u2019s respective usage of the aircraft, for which they are separately billed by the entity described above.\nWe share equally in fixed and nonrecurring costs for the aircraft; direct operating costs are pro-rated based on actual usage. Another aircraft that had previously been\njointly-owned by the companies was sold in November 2022, with each company receiving 50% of the $19 million in net sale proceeds.\nIn addition, in 2021, we entered into agreements pursuant to which we may use additional aircraft owned by a subsidiary of IAC on a cost basis. Total\npayments made to this entity by the Company were not material.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the net basis in our ownership interest in the aircrafts then jointly-owned was $43 million and $46 million, respectively,\nrecorded in long-term investments and other assets. In 2023, 2022 and 2021, operating and maintenance costs paid directly to the jointly-owned subsidiary for the\naircraft were not material.\nNOTE 18 \u2014 Segment Information\nWe have the following reportable segments: B2C (formerly referred to as Retail), B2B, and trivago. Our B2C segment provides a full range of travel and\nadvertising services to our worldwide customers through a variety of consumer brands including: Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, Travelocity, Wotif Group,\nebookers, CheapTickets, Hotwire.com and CarRentals.com. Our B2B segment fuels a wide range of travel and non-travel companies including airlines, offline travel\nagents, online retailers, corporate travel management and financial institutions, who leverage our leading travel technology and tap into our diverse supply to\naugment their offerings and market Expedia Group rates and availabilities to their travelers. In addition, through its sale in November 2021, our B2B segment\nincluded Egencia, a full-service travel management company that provided travel services to businesses and their corporate customers. Our trivago segment generates\nadvertising revenue primarily from sending referrals to online travel companies and travel service providers from its hotel metasearch websites.\nWe determined our operating segments based on how our chief operating decision makers manage our business, make operating decisions and evaluate\noperating performance. Our primary operating metric is Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for our B2C and B2B segments includes allocations of certain\nexpenses, primarily related to our global travel supply organization and the majority of costs from our product and technology platform, as well as facility costs and\nthe realized foreign currency gains or losses related to the forward contracts hedging a component of our net merchant lodging revenue. We base the allocations\nprimarily on transaction volumes and other usage metrics. We do not allocate certain shared expenses such as accounting, human resources, certain information\ntechnology and legal to our reportable segments. We include these expenses in Corporate and Eliminations. Our allocation methodology is periodically evaluated and\nmay change.\nOur segment disclosure includes intersegment revenues, which primarily consist of advertising and media services provided by our trivago segment to our B2C\nsegment. These intersegment transactions are recorded by each segment at amounts that approximate fair value as if the transactions were between third parties, and\ntherefore, impact segment performance. However, the revenue and corresponding expense are eliminated in consolidation.

Certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and the DGCL could make it more difficult to consummate an acquisition of control of us by\nmeans of a tender offer, a proxy fight, open market purchases or otherwise in a transaction not approved by our Board of Directors. The provisions described below\nmay reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited proposal for the restructuring or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or an unsolicited takeover attempt which is\nunfair to our stockholders. The summary of the provisions set forth below does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our\nCertificate of Incorporation, our Bylaws and the DGCL.\nBusiness Combinations. Section 203 of the DGCL prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with a stockholder who\nowns 15% or more of the corporation\u2019s voting stock (which is referred to as an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d) for three years following the time that such stockholder\nbecame an interested stockholder unless (i) prior to the time such stockholder became an interested stockholder, the board of directors approved either the business\ncombination or the transaction which resulted in such stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, (ii) upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in\nthe stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, such stockholder owns at least 85% of the voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced\n(subject to certain exclusions), or (iii) at or subsequent to such time, the business combination is approved by the board of directors and by the affirmative vote (but\nnot written consent) of at least 66 2/3% of the corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder. A Delaware corporation may opt\nout of Section 203 of the DGCL in its certificate of incorporation or a stockholder approved bylaw. Because we have not opted out of Section 203 of the DGCL, we\nremain subject to such provision.\nSpecial Meetings. Under the DGCL, a special meeting of stockholders may be called by the board of directors or by any other person authorized to do so in\nthe certificate of incorporation or bylaws. Under our Certificate of Incorporation, special meetings of stockholders may only be called by a majority of our Board of\nDirectors or the Chairman of our Board of Directors.\nBoard Vacancies. Our Bylaws provide that vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors may\nbe filled by the vote of a majority of the remaining directors elected by the stockholders who vote on such directorship, though less than a quorum, or a majority of\nthe voting power of shares of such stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote on such directorship at a special meeting held for such purpose or by the written\nconsent of a majority of the voting power of shares of such stock issued and outstanding. The directors so chosen shall hold office until the next annual election and\nuntil their respective successors are duly elected.\nEqual Treatment of Stockholders in Change of Control Transactions. Under our Certificate of Incorporation, the Company may not enter into a change of\ncontrol transaction involving at least 50% of the outstanding shares of our capital stock that provides for different consideration in respect of shares of our common\nstock and our Class B common stock, subject to limited exceptions, and no holder of certain shares of Class B common stock may participate in, or vote or tender in\nfavor of, any such change of control transaction that provides for such differential consideration.
