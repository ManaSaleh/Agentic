We offer these\nservices through five primary consumer-facing brands: Booking.com, Priceline, Agoda, KAYAK, and OpenTable:\nWe are proud that, despite challenges to our global community such as the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East and the impact of inflation, we\ncontinued our efforts to make our brands the most trusted and convenient platforms for consumers and partners, including:\n\u2022achieving record annual room nights in 2023;\n\u2022continuing to increase room nights and brand awareness in key markets such as the U.S.;\n\u2022strongly growing our alternative accommodations offering;\n\u2022improving our loyalty programs, particularly the Genius program at Booking.com, and increasing our focus on value for our consumers;\n\u2022further integrating artificial intelligence (\"AI\") technology into our offerings;\n\u2022improving and expanding our flight offering at Booking.com and extending our partnership with Etraveli Group through at least 2028; and\n\u2022increasing adoption of our payments platform and capabilities.\nOur common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol \"BKNG.\" We refer to our company and all of our subsidiaries and\nbrands collectively as \"Booking Holdings,\" the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"our,\" or \"us.\"\n1", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3011, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5124b14-d732-45bb-b7cb-c8edf62d8db4": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5124b14-d732-45bb-b7cb-c8edf62d8db4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "58eea1a9-87ac-4dd0-83db-bb0aae15c85b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "7e9cb2a80bb8d06190b346fa389639ff60cafe0f5289f247931303a6f41df588", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Our Business Model\n \nWe derive substantially all of our revenues from providing online travel reservation services, which facilitate online travel purchases between travel\nservice providers and travelers (which we generally refer to as \"partners\" and \"consumers,\" respectively). We also earn revenues from advertising services,\nrestaurant reservations, and various other services, such as travel-related insurance and restaurant management services.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we had revenues of $21.4 billion, which we classify as \"merchant\" revenues, \"agency\" revenues, and\n\"advertising and other\" revenues.\n\u2022Merchant revenues are derived from transactions where we facilitate payments from travelers for the services provided, generally at the time of\nbooking. Merchant revenues include travel reservation commissions and transaction net revenues (i.e., the amount charged to travelers, including\nthe impact of merchandising, less the amount owed to travel service providers); credit card processing rebates and customer processing fees; and\nancillary fees, including travel-related insurance revenues. The majority of our merchant revenue is from Booking.com's accommodation\nreservations.\n\u2022Agency revenues are derived from travel-related transactions where we do not facilitate payments from travelers for the services provided. Agency\nrevenues consist almost entirely of travel reservation commissions from our reservation services. Substantially all of our agency revenue is from\nBooking.com's accommodation reservations.\n\u2022Advertising and other revenues are derived primarily from (a) revenues earned by KAYAK for sending referrals to online travel companies\n(\"OTCs\") and travel service providers and for advertising placements on its platforms and (b) revenues earned by OpenTable for its restaurant\nreservation services and subscription fees for restaurant management services.\nOur Strategy\n \nWe aim to demonstrate global leadership in online travel bookings and related services by:\n\u2022making it easy for people to find, book, pay for, and experience travel;\n\u2022providing consumers with the most comprehensive choices and value on any device;\n\u2022offering platforms, tools, and insights to our business partners to help them be successful; and\n\u2022operating our business sustainably and supporting sustainable travel choices by our consumers and partners.\nWe focus on relentless innovation and execution and a commitment to serve both consumers and partners with unmatched service and best-in-class\ntechnology. We believe that global travel bookings will generally continue to grow while shifting from traditional offline methods to online channels like ours.\nWe expect to benefit from this growth in travel and the continued shift to online channels as we work to expand our service offerings and increase our presence in\nkey geographies. In particular, we seek to (a) leverage technology to provide consumers with the best experience, (b) partner with travel service providers and\nrestaurants to our mutual benefit, (c) operate multiple brands that collaborate with each other, and (d) invest in profitable and sustainable growth.\nProvide the best consumer experience. We focus on providing consumers with: (a) personalized and easy-to-use online travel services; (b) a\ncomprehensive selection of travel and payment options; (c) informative and useful content; (d) excellent customer service; and (e) value through competitive\nprices and loyalty programs.\nWe continue to innovate to meet the needs of our consumers and partners through intuitive, easy-to-use websites and mobile apps. An increasing\npercentage of our room nights are booked on our mobile apps. We believe that our development of payments capabilities across the Company removes friction\nfrom the booking process and delivers additional value for travelers. We continue to execute against our long-term strategy to create an ideal traveler experience,\noffering our customers relevant options and connections at the times and in the language they want them, making trips booked with us seamless, easy, and\nvaluable. We refer to this as the \"Connected Trip.\" The goal of our Connected Trip vision is to offer a differentiated and personalized online travel planning,\nbooking, payment, and in-trip experience for each trip, enhanced by a robust loyalty program that provides value to travelers and partners across all trips. In the\nnear term, we are focused on providing consumers the ability to build a complete travel itinerary on our platforms by, for example, enabling them to book\nconvenient ground transportation to coincide with their flight arrival or attractions near their accommodation, and developing a generative AI assisted trip\nplanner. We also continue to grow verticals such as our flight offering, with 2023 flight ticket growth across the\n2", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4833, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "889403e8-eb04-4d66-aa06-4ebf33c02f46": {"__data__": {"id_": "889403e8-eb04-4d66-aa06-4ebf33c02f46", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d0bced5f-1ee0-4d1a-912e-ab6e3a9fc082", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "4fd86bc7482cc170bd9392fdcc09056b812de6d4645adaf97e8d871d66647cef", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Company of 58% year-over-year.

The markets for the services we offer are\nintensely competitive and constantly evolving. Current and new competitors launch new services at a relatively low cost. Some of our current and potential\ncompetitors include the largest global technology companies, which have significantly more customers or users, consumer data, and resources than we do, and\nmay be able to leverage other aspects of their businesses (e.g., search or mobile device businesses, or generative AI capabilities) to compete more effectively with\nus. For example, Google's online travel offerings have grown rapidly in this area by linking travel search services to its dominant search functionality through\nflight, hotel, and alternative accommodations meta-search products, and by integrating such products into its Google Maps app.\nWe currently, or may in the future, compete with a variety of companies, including:\n\u2022online travel or restaurant reservation services and meta-search services;\n\u2022large online search, social networking, and marketplace companies;\n\u2022travel service providers (e.g., accommodations, rental car companies, or airlines);\n\u2022traditional travel agencies, travel management companies, wholesalers, and tour operators; and\n\u2022companies offering technology services and software solutions to travel service providers.\nFor more information regarding current and potential competitors and the competitive nature of the markets in which we operate, see Part I, Item 1A,\nRisk Factors - \"Intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance.\"\nGovernment Regulation\nOur ability to provide our services and any future services is affected by legal regulations of governments and regulatory authorities around the world,\nmany of which are evolving and subject to revised interpretations. Violations of any laws or regulations could result in fines, penalties, and criminal sanctions\nagainst us, our officers or employees, and prohibitions on how or where we conduct our business, which could damage our reputation, brands, global expansion\nefforts, ability to attract and retain employees and business partners, business, and operating results. Even if we comply with these laws and regulations, doing\nbusiness in certain jurisdictions or violations of these laws and regulations by the parties with which we conduct business runs the risk of harming our reputation\nand our brands. Regulations that impact our business or our industry include:\n\u2022Data Protection and Privacy: We have policies and a global governance framework to comply with privacy laws that apply to our business, meet\nevolving stakeholder expectations, and support business innovation and growth. In the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (the\n\"GDPR\") imposes significant compliance obligations and costs. In the United States, the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \"CCPA\") and the\nCalifornia Privacy Rights Act (\"CPRA\") impose privacy requirements and rights for consumers in California that will result in additional compliance\ncomplexity, risks, and costs. Other U.S. states and jurisdictions globally have adopted or may adopt similar data protection regulations. Some data\nprotection and privacy laws afford consumers a private right of action against companies like ours for certain statutory violations.\n\u2022Competition, Consumer Protection and Online Commerce: Competition and consumer protection authorities are increasingly focused on large\ntechnology companies, including in relation to the regulation of digital platforms. The Digital Markets Act (\"DMA\") and Digital Services Act (\"DSA\")\ngive regulators in the EU more instruments to investigate and regulate digital businesses and impose new rules and requirements on platforms\ndesignated as \"gatekeepers\" under the DMA and online platforms more generally, with separate rules for \"Very Large Online Platforms\" (\"VLOPs\")\nunder the DSA. In 2023, Booking.com received a VLOP designation notice from the European Commission. The Company has met the quantitative\nnotification criteria set forth in the DMA and expects to notify the European Commission of that fact within the required deadline.\n4", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4558, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "35e9b78e-e9d6-4271-9891-3e2c44d7dbed": {"__data__": {"id_": "35e9b78e-e9d6-4271-9891-3e2c44d7dbed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0f6a77ec-ebf4-4130-aa17-b4e3a168e7de", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "5f401c7c129af53180d1b7f58823a5dc7e5e2d8f6c1c76678bb0d12d38c515b7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\u2022Regulation of the Travel Industry: Our business is impacted by travel-related regulations such as local regulation of the use of alternative\naccommodations. Local jurisdictions around the world have instituted a variety of measures to address the issues of \"overtourism\" and the impact of\ntourism on the climate. As our business evolves, we expect to become subject to existing and new regulations. For example, some parts of our business\nare already subject to certain requirements of the EU Package Travel Directive (the \"Package Directive\"), and as our offerings continue to diversify and\nexpand, we may become subject to additional requirements of the Package Directive.\n\u2022Payments: As we expand our payments services to consumers and business partners, we are subject to additional regulations, such as financial services\nregulations and license requirements, which has resulted in increased compliance costs and complexities, including those associated with the\nimplementation of new or advanced internal controls. We are also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under our contracts with\npayment card processors, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, compliance with which is complex and costly.\nFor further discussion of these regulations and how other global regulations may impact our business, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - \"Information\nSecurity, Cybersecurity, and Data Privacy Risks\" and \"Legal, Regulatory, Compliance, and Reputational Risks .\"\nTechnology\n \nOur business is supported by multiple systems and platforms designed with an emphasis on scalability, performance, redundancy, and security. Our\nsystems connect us with vendors and partners. We are modernizing our technology by building new applications with modern development tools and application\nprogramming interfaces, and we increasingly rely upon public cloud infrastructure. Our applications utilize digital certificates and other security technologies to\nhelp us conduct secure communications and transactions, as appropriate. The systems infrastructure and web and database servers of our worldwide operations\nare hosted in data centers in Europe, Asia, and North America, and each provides services and support typical of hosted data centers. For discussion of risks\nrelating to our technology, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - \"Information Security, Cybersecurity, and Data Privacy Risks.\"\nIntellectual Property\n \nThe protection of our intellectual property is important to our success. We rely on intellectual property such as trademarks, copyrights, patents, and trade\nsecrets to support our business as well as domain names or other intangible rights or property secured through purchase, licensing, or other agreements with\nemployees, travel service providers, vendors, and other parties. We have filed applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property in the\nUnited States and other jurisdictions, and we currently hold a number of issued patents in several jurisdictions. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - \"We face risks\nrelated to our intellectual property.\"\nSeasonality and Other Timing Factors\nIn 2023, our gross bookings were generally similar in the first three quarters of the year and higher than in the fourth quarter. We generally recognize\nour marketing activities as the expense is incurred, which is typically in the quarter when the gross bookings for the associated reservations are recognized.\nHowever, we would generally recognize revenue from these bookings when the travel begins (at \"check-in\"), and accommodation check-ins in Europe and North\nAmerica are generally highest in the third quarter during those regions' peak summer travel season and lowest in the first quarter. As a result of this timing\ndifference between when we record marketing expenses and when we generally recognize associated revenues, we typically experience our highest levels of\nprofitability in the third quarter and our lowest level of profitability in the first quarter. In addition to the typical seasonality effects on our business, our quarterly\nresults and quarterly year-over-year growth rates can be impacted by:\n\u2022The length of the booking window (the average time between the booking of a travel reservation and when the travel begins), which impacts the\nrelationship between our gross bookings (recognized at the time of booking) and our revenues (recognized at the time of check-in).

We are committed to engaging\nwith our employees across our Company and maintaining a productive workforce that is proud to work for Booking Holdings.\nWorkforce\nOur Board of Directors and the Talent and Compensation Committee have oversight of our human capital management. As a result of our operating\nstructure with multiple distinct brands, our approach to human capital management can vary by brand.\nAt December 31, 2023, we employed approximately 23,600 employees, of which approximately 3,100 were based in the United States, and\napproximately 20,500 were based outside the United States. Approximately 99% of our employees are full-time employees. We also retain independent\ncontractors, including to support our customer service, website content translation, and system support functions.\nEmployees by Geography (as of December 31, 2023)\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\nOur commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion means honoring all experiences, valuing all voices, and leading with empathy on our journey to\nbecome a more inclusive company. We believe that a diverse workforce operating in an inclusive environment is critical to leveraging our human capital to\nachieve our long-term strategic goals. We strive for our leadership and workforce to reflect the broad spectrum of people we work with throughout the world\nbecause we believe this is the best way for us to connect with the viewpoints, backgrounds, and experiences of our customers and partners. We are committed to\ncreating workplaces that embrace and celebrate the different cultures and practices of our employees and we prohibit unlawful discrimination of any type.\nAs of December 31, 2023, approximately 47% of our employees were women, approximately 23% of our technology positions were filled by women,\nand approximately 32% of leadership (which includes vice presidents and above for all brands except Booking.com, which includes senior directors and above\ndue to a greater number of employees) were women. We are committed to pay equity, regardless of gender, race, or ethnicity.

For example, all of our brands include diversity and\ninclusion questions in annual employee engagement surveys to gauge our inclusivity progress. We also publish our consolidated EEO-1 report for employees in\nthe United States, although as of December 31, 2023, this represents only approximately 13% of our workforce.\nWe encourage equality and inclusivity across our workforce through various initiatives. As part of our recruitment efforts to ensure that candidate slates\nare diverse, we use diversity-focused sourcing platforms, we apply an inclusive language tool to job descriptions to attract candidates of all backgrounds, and we\nhold recruiters accountable for presenting multicultural candidates by tying it to their performance goals. In addition, we provide training to ensure interviewers\nconsider all candidates objectively.\nWe have invested in a robust inclusive leadership training program and unconscious bias training for our leaders and we continue to cascade these\ninitiatives further into the organization to ensure that these tenets contribute to our strategy. Additionally, we are entering our eighth year of operating our Women\nin Leadership program, which is a Company-wide initiative designed to support the advancement and development of high-performing women within our\ncompany with the goal of building and enabling gender diversity in our executive pipeline. We sponsor various employee resource groups, including those that\nsupport the LGBTQ community and its allies, employees with differing physical and mental abilities, the Black and persons-of-color (POC) community, veteran\nemployees, and gender equality, among others.

We believe that we offer a rich culture where employees feel empowered to do their best work with opportunities to grow as well as competitive\ncompensation and benefits. For example, while the specifics can vary by brand, in the United States our employee benefit plans generally include: coverage for\nfertility treatments, gender reassignment surgery, gender-neutral domestic partner benefits, and paid leave for new parents and grandparents, those caring for a\nloved one, or bereavement.\nWe create opportunities for employees to grow and build their careers through training and development programs. These include offering tailored\nlearning opportunities to enable employees to upskill while at work and driving frequent career conversations between employees and their managers, as well as\nexecutive succession planning.\nCompetition for talent in our industry has historically been intense. However, the proliferation of global working from anywhere policies and the\nassociated increased ability for employees to seek out and switch jobs that may not have been accessible to them previously has heightened the competition for\nemployees even further, particularly software engineers, mobile communications talent, and other technology professionals. As a result, the competition for talent\nin our industry combined with inflationary pressure on compensation has caused our expenses to attract and retain key talent to increase. We continue to focus on\nour employees' engagement and mental well-being, career satisfaction, development, and succession planning.\n7", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3829, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d850474b-319d-43cd-8f68-488d728532a3": {"__data__": {"id_": "d850474b-319d-43cd-8f68-488d728532a3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ef43c0c5-028f-4618-99e6-61e83191cfc9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "9c8c7ab218ef80c7c9c8d5fe6bb9b3ac22aa1e22148975df6e7dde918cd45ac4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We recognize that expectations for the ways and places in which employees work have shifted dramatically since 2020.

Demand for and sales\nof travel services often decline during periods of perceived or actual adverse economic conditions and times of political or economic uncertainty. Economic and\npolitical uncertainty can negatively impact transaction growth rates, cancellation rates, and accommodation average daily rates (\"ADRs\"). While lower\noccupancy rates can increase distribution of accommodation reservations through third-party intermediaries such as us, if there are lower ADRs, it generally has\na negative effect on our revenues and results of operations. For a discussion of occupancy rates and ADRs, see Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Trends.\nMacroeconomic uncertainties have led to significant volatility in currency exchange rates, stock markets, and oil prices, which can impact consumer\ntravel behavior.

Responses to such events by governments or global organizations could restrict travel in ways that could impact our\nability to conduct our business. Because these events and their impacts and responses to them are largely unpredictable, they can dramatically and suddenly\naffect travel behavior by consumers, demand for and provision of our services, and relationships with travel service providers and other partners, any of which\ncan adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIntense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance.\nWe compete globally with both online and traditional travel and restaurant reservation and related services. The markets for the services we offer are\nintensely competitive and constantly evolving. Current and new competitors launch new services at a relatively low cost. Some of our current and potential\ncompetitors include the largest global technology companies, which have significantly more customers or users, consumer data, and resources than we do, and\nmay be able to leverage other aspects of their businesses (e.g., search or mobile device businesses or generative AI capabilities) to compete with us. For example,\nGoogle's online travel offerings have grown rapidly by linking travel search services to its dominant search functionality through flight, hotel, and alternative\naccommodations meta-search products, and integrating such products into Google Maps. The structure of the travel industry or consumer preferences could also\nchange in ways that disadvantage us and benefit competitors or new entrants. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw a shift in favor of domestic\ntravel and alternative accommodations, which benefited competitors more established in those areas. If we are unable to successfully adapt to such changes, our\nability to compete, and our business and results of operations, would be adversely affected.\nWe currently, or may in the future, compete with companies that provide a variety of products and services, including:\n\u2022online platforms, including accommodation and alternative accommodation search or reservation services, travel meta-search and price comparison\nservices, and large online companies including in search, social networking, marketplace, artificial intelligence, and ride-sharing;\n\u2022travel service providers (e.g., accommodations, rental car companies, or airlines), which may offer lower prices on their direct channel than they provide\nto us;\n\u2022traditional travel agencies, travel management companies, wholesalers and tour operators; and\n\u2022companies offering technology services and software solutions to travel service providers, including large global distribution systems (\"GDSs\") and\nhospitality software and payments platforms.\nMeta-search services aggregate travel search results for the consumer's specific itinerary across travel service providers, OTCs, and other online\nplatforms and compete directly with us for customers. Google leverages its general search business to compete with Kayak by showing its own meta-search\nresults at the top of its organic search results, and offers its meta-search services free to travel service providers. Furthermore, meta-search services may evolve\ninto more traditional OTCs by offering consumers the ability to make travel reservations directly.\nWe compete with constantly evolving online and/or mobile application platforms. The market for accommodations covers a wide range of property\ntypes including alternative accommodations. As such, companies like Airbnb and Vrbo (owned by Expedia) compete directly with our accommodations\nbusinesses. Meta-search services may lower the cost for new companies to enter the market by providing a distribution channel without the cost of promoting the\nnew entrant's brand. Moreover, some of our competitors and potential competitors offer a variety of online services, many of which are used by consumers more\nfrequently than online travel services or have created \"super-apps\" where consumers can use such various services without leaving the company's app. A\ncompetitor that has established other, more frequent online or app-based interactions with consumers may be able to more easily or cost-effectively acquire\ncustomers for its online travel services than we can. Some competitors include private equity-funded platforms, which can more easily withstand significant\nlosses for an extended period of time while building market share through heavy marketing and/or discounting of their services. In addition, competitors may\nmore effectively invest in new online marketing channels such as TikTok, which could hinder growth of our services if they are more successful at promoting\ntheir platform via social media.\nFor many consumers, the price of the travel service is the primary factor determining whether to book a reservation.

As a result, in certain markets, we may need to provide discounts or other incentives in order to be competitive, which may make it difficult for us\nto maintain or grow market share, maintain historical profit margins, and may also result in lower ADRs and lower revenues as a\n10", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4462, "end_char_idx": 5892, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "46a46661-59d1-4f93-84db-aa7ea524b98c": {"__data__": {"id_": "46a46661-59d1-4f93-84db-aa7ea524b98c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1d81dff7-98f9-48f3-8a5b-e11afa67ff0d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "084bbaa0f06e30b971c0a29e9da6c615a360d93c2cb09dbf2a3457c7e8c7392a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5fe52e5a-57b7-444e-a574-2ce3ef837806", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0de839f239ee724a87c35c285e174f43391cfe290551f7559096c3828a216812", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "percentage of gross bookings. Further, consolidation among travel service providers could result in lower OTC commission rates, increased discounting, and\ngreater incentives for consumers to join closed-user groups as such travel service providers expand their offerings. If we are unable to effectively offer\ncompetitive prices, our market share, business, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe face risks related to the growth rate and the global expansion of our business.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues and have significant operations outside the United States. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, our OTC\noperations outside of the United States historically had achieved significant year-over-year growth in their gross bookings. Without taking into consideration the\nrecent declines caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, these growth rates had generally declined over time as the absolute level of our gross bookings increased and\nonline travel growth rates declined. In addition to the general slowing growth rates of online travel, other factors may also slow the growth rates of our\nbusinesses outside of the United States, including economic conditions, strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus other currencies, declines in ADRs, increases in\ncancellations, adverse changes in travel market conditions, and competition. Any decline in the growth rates of our businesses could negatively impact our\nrevenue and earnings growth rates and as a consequence our stock price.\nWe are also subject to risks related to expanding our business internationally. International markets may have strong local competitors with an\nestablished brand and travel service provider or restaurant relationships making expansion in that market difficult or costly. Certain markets in which we operate\nhave unique localized preferences and lower operating margins compared to other markets. Scaling and growing our business in such markets could require\nsignificant investment, which could have a negative impact on our profit margins. In some markets such as China, legal and other regulatory requirements may\nrestrict participation by foreign businesses. Such restrictions could make our entry into and expansion in those markets difficult or impossible, require that we\nwork with a local partner, or result in higher operating costs. If we are unsuccessful in expanding in new and existing markets and managing that expansion, our\nbusiness and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that the breadth, variety, and quality of accommodations on our platforms is a key driver of our growth. The growth rate of the number of\naccommodations on our platforms may vary in part as a result of removing accommodations from our platforms from time to time. Many of the newer\naccommodations we add to our travel reservation services, especially in highly-penetrated markets, may have fewer rooms or higher credit risk and may appeal\nto a smaller subset of consumers (e.g., hostels and bed and breakfasts). If occupancy rates increase, accommodation providers often limit the amount of business\nthat flows through certain distribution channels. Also, certain jurisdictions have instituted regulations intended to address the issues of \"overtourism\" and the\nimpact of tourism on climate, including by restricting accommodation offerings near popular tourist destinations, which has limited the number of tourists\npermitted to visit and stay near popular areas. As a result, we may experience constraints on the number of listings or accommodation room nights actually\navailable to us or could experience a decrease in demand if consumers cannot book the experiences they would like during their trip, which could negatively\nimpact our business growth rate and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on travel service providers, restaurants, search platforms, and other third parties.\nWe rely on providers of accommodations, rental cars, and airline tickets, and on restaurants, to make their services available to consumers for\nreservation through us. Our arrangements with travel service providers generally do not require them to make available any specific quantity of reservations, or\nto make reservations available in any geographic area, for any particular route, or at any particular price. Similarly, our arrangements with restaurants generally\ndo not require them to provide all of their available tables and reservations to customers through us. Our arrangements with OTCs and travel service providers to\nprovide pricing, schedules, availability, and other information in connection with Kayak's meta-search services are non-exclusive and can be terminated with\nlittle notice. A significant reduction on the part of any of our major travel service providers, or restaurants, for a sustained period of time or their complete\nwithdrawal from our services could have a material adverse effect on our business, market share, and results of operations. Further, as consolidation among travel\nservice providers increases, the potential adverse effect of a decision by a significant travel service provider to withdraw from or reduce its participation in our\nservices also increases.

In addition, a decline or slowing growth in travel search traffic negatively impacts our ability to efficiently generate\ntraffic to our platforms through performance marketing on general search platforms, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of\noperations.\nWe rely on various third-party distribution channels (i.e., marketing affiliates) to distribute accommodation, rental car, and airline ticket reservations.\nShould one or more of such third parties cease distribution of reservations made through us, or suffer deterioration in its search or meta-search ranking, our\nbusiness, market share, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe offer a range of insurance products related to our travel offerings, primarily through third-party insurance providers. Our business and reputation\nmay be adversely affected if such providers no longer make such offerings available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all.\nWe face risks related to the growth of our alternative accommodations business.\nOur alternative accommodations business may face risks relating to claims of liability, regulatory developments, and continued growth and profitability.\nBecause alternative accommodations are often either a single unit or a small collection of independent units, and may have additional costs to be offered on our\nplatforms, these properties generally represent more limited booking opportunities and lower profit margins than hotels, motels, and resorts. Further, alternative\naccommodations may be subject to increased seasonality or may not be available at peak times due to use by property owners. To the extent alternative\naccommodations represent an increasing percentage of the properties we add to our platforms, we expect that our room-night growth rate and property growth\nrate will continue to diverge over time, and the number of reservations per property will likely continue to decrease.\nIn addition, alternative accommodations are subject to claims of liability based on injury, death, discrimination, or criminal activities occurring at these\nproperties. We have no control over the actions of our consumers, property owners, and other third parties during the customer's stay, and cannot guarantee the\nsafety of such individuals. In addition, we have not in the past and may not in the future undertake to systematically verify the safety, quality, and legal\ncompliance of our alternative accommodation listings. We rely on property owners to disclose information relating to their listings and such information may be\ninaccurate or incomplete. In addition, Booking.com facilitates the provision of partner liability insurance that may protect alternative accommodation partners\nagainst liability claims, lawsuits by third parties for bodily injury, or personal property damage that occur during a stay at a partner property. This partner liability\ninsurance, if applicable to the claim, may provide partners with up to $1.0 million equivalent (policy limit) of third party liability coverage related to the\nunderlying claim. The Company could be required to pay amounts in excess of the partner liability policy limit. Any resulting complaints or claims could result\nin negative publicity and increased costs, which could adversely affect our reputation, business, and results of operations.\nThe regulatory environment related to the alternative accommodations business is evolving, and laws, regulations, or property association rules could\nimpose restrictions or burdens on property owners and managers that limit or negatively affect their ability to rent their properties. For example, the European\nCommission has adopted a short-term rental regulation that imposes new obligations around property owner registration, property verification, and enforcement\nof local registration schemes, and in conjunction with the Digital Services Act. For additional discussion regarding the Digital Services Act, see - \"Our business\nis subject to various competition/anti-trust, consumer protection, and online commerce laws and regulations around the world, and as the size of our business\ngrows, scrutiny of our business by legislators and regulators in these areas may intensify.\" Some jurisdictions have adopted or are considering legal restrictions\nthat prohibit owners and managers from renting certain properties for fewer than a stated number of consecutive days or for more than an aggregate total number\nof days per year or that require online platforms, owners or managers to obtain a license to rent or list alternative accommodations. From time to time, we are\nsubject to inquiries related to compliance with alternative accommodation legal requirements that we may not be able to respond to in a timely manner or in full\nsatisfaction. The outcome of such inquiries has resulted in fines and could result in additional fines, adversely affect our reputation, or require modifications to\nour business operations. Legal requirements applicable to alternative accommodations are evolving and can be inconsistent among each individual locality. As\ngovernments adopt new legal requirements related to alternative accommodations, we are unable to predict what effect they may have on our business. This\ndynamic regulatory environment requires us to expend significant time and resources and could negatively impact the growth and/or size of our alternative\naccommodation reservation business.\n12", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5653, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "260850b0-39c6-4607-a736-7ab6cf96bc62": {"__data__": {"id_": "260850b0-39c6-4607-a736-7ab6cf96bc62", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "01d23b41-d193-4993-8278-676b70a56eaf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "a15466f858161cc8dbb71204d10742a35674b9f7bdc3a5f06d530cddc5c65146", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b3ff3c5b-9464-44fe-a206-9aa22a643d2b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "37169bd7f142946ea1f29deae829a6b3b8fb70cda3ee38f65e62dbed1f9be893", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We face risks relating to our marketing efforts.\nWe invest considerable resources in the establishment and maintenance of our brands, and we intend to continue to invest resources in marketing and\nother brand building efforts to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brands and attract and retain customers.

If we are unable to maintain or enhance\nconsumer awareness and acceptance of our brands or if such efforts are not cost-effective, our business, market share, and results of operations would be\nmaterially adversely affected.\nOur marketing efficiency, expressed as marketing expense as a percentage of revenues, is impacted by a number of factors that are subject to variability\nand are in some cases outside of our control, including ADRs, costs per click, cancellation rates, foreign currency exchange rates, our ability to convert paid\ntraffic to booking customers, and the extent to which consumers come directly to our websites or mobile apps for bookings. If our marketing efforts are less\neffective at generating new bookings, our marketing efficiency could deteriorate and our margins, revenues, and earnings growth could be adversely affected. For\nexample, competition for desired rankings in search results and/or a decline in ad clicks by consumers could increase our costs-per-click and negatively impact\nour marketing efficiency. For more information regarding the role of online search engines in generating traffic to our websites, see - \"We are dependent on travel\nservice providers, restaurants, search platforms, and other third parties.\" At times we may pursue a strategy of increasing marketing returns on investment\n(\"ROIs\"), which could negatively affect our gross bookings and revenue growth rates. Pursuing a strategy of improving performance marketing ROIs along with\nfactors such as competitors' actions in the bidding environment, the amount of marketing invested by these channels to generate demand, and overall marketing\nplatform traffic growth trends, may also impact growth rates for marketing channels. Additionally, many factors could cause consumers to increase their\nshopping activity before making a travel purchase. Increased shopping activity impedes our marketing efficiency and effectiveness because traffic becomes less\nlikely to result in a reservation through our platforms, and such traffic is more likely to be obtained through paid marketing channels than through direct\nchannels. Any negative trends in our marketing efficiency, performance marketing ROIs, or consumer shopping activity could negatively impact our business,\nmarket share, and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to keep up with rapid technological or other market changes.\nWe compete in markets characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, consolidation, frequent service developments, and\nchanging consumer preferences.

Emerging start-ups may be able to innovate and focus on developing a particularly new product or service faster than we can or may foresee\nconsumer need for new services or technologies before we do. In addition, the widespread adoption of new technologies, such as generative artificial intelligence\nand machine learning (\"AI\"), could influence how customers search for and book travel, require us to modify or adapt our services or infrastructure, and subject\nus to new regulatory frameworks, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. For example, the development, adoption, and uses\nfor AI technologies, which we are incorporating into certain of our offerings, are still in their early stages and the regulatory framework for its use is uncertain.\nThe use of AI presents risks and challenges because in some instances we may make use of third-party foundational models that have been pre-trained on data\nwhich may be insufficient, erroneous, stale, contain biased information, or infringe IP rights. Additionally, the output produced by these models may be\ninaccurate, misleading, discriminatory, offensive, illegal or otherwise harmful. Such risks are heightened if we or third-party developers or vendors lack sufficient\nresponsible AI development or governance practices. These deficiencies and other failures of AI systems could subject us to competitive harm, regulatory action,\nlegal liability, and brand or reputational harm.\nWe rely on the performance of highly skilled employees; and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key employees or hire, retain, and motivate well-\nqualified employees, our business would be harmed.\nOur performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals, including key senior management in the United States,\nEurope, and Asia. We may not be able to retain the services of key employees, the loss of whom could harm our business and competitive position. Our future\nsuccess and ability to innovate depends on our continuing to identify, attract, hire, develop, motivate, and retain a highly skilled, global, diverse workforce. In\naddition, our customer service resources and outsource arrangements for customer support may be unable to provide adequate customer service support. There\nmay continue to be operational and workplace cultural challenges that may adversely affect our business, including talent retention, in connection with changes\nto work environments due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCompetition for well-qualified employees in all aspects of our business, especially software engineers, mobile communication talent, product\nprofessionals, and other technology professionals, is intense and costly. In particular, our success in global markets has led to increased efforts by our competitors\nand others to hire our employees. These difficulties may be amplified by increased ability to work remotely, evolving restrictions on immigration or availability\nof visas or work permits for skilled technology workers, requirements of applicable collective bargaining agreements, and laws in jurisdictions where we operate\nthat make recruiting senior talent more difficult, such as the reductions in the (partial) tax exemption that benefits certain non-Dutch citizens working in the\nNetherlands. The competition for talent in our industry and with companies with whom we did not historically compete combined with inflationary pressure on\ncompensation has caused our personnel expenses to attract and retain key talent to increase, which may adversely affect our results of operations. If we do not\nsucceed in attracting and retaining well-qualified employees, our business, our ability to grow and innovate, competitive position, reputation, and results of\noperations would be adversely affected.\nConsumer adoption and use of mobile devices creates challenges and may enable device companies such as Google and Apple to compete directly with\nus.\nWidespread adoption of mobile devices, particularly smartphones, coupled with the web browsing functionality and development of apps available on\nthese devices, continues to drive substantial online traffic and commerce to mobile platforms. We have experienced a significant shift of business, both direct and\nindirect, to mobile platforms, and we believe that mobile bookings are necessary to maintain and grow our business as consumers increasingly turn to mobile\ndevices instead of a personal computer. The revenues earned on a mobile transaction may be less than a typical desktop transaction due to different consumer\npurchasing patterns. To the extent mobile devices or platforms enable users to block advertising content, our advertising revenue and our ability to market our\nbrands may also be negatively affected.

Future events and changing\nmarket conditions, like significant adverse changes in the market valuations of companies in the travel and technology industries, may result in the need to\nrecognize goodwill, investment, and asset impairment charges, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAny significant increase in our provision for expected credit losses and any significant increase in cash outlays to refund consumers could have a\ncorresponding adverse effect on our results of operations and related cash flows. We could experience a high level of cancellations of existing reservations which\ncould result in higher than normal cash outlays to refund consumers for prepaid reservations. In some instances, where we had agreed to provide free\ncancellations to consumers for non-refundable reservations, we did not estimate a recovery of prepayment already made to a travel service provider. We may also\noffer cancellable room rates on behalf of a partner to provide flexibility to our consumers even if the partner has not provided a cancellable room rate, which\ncould have a negative impact on our revenues if we are unable to facilitate booking from another customer.\nWe face risks related to our operational and technological infrastructures.\nHistorically, our brands operated on a largely independent basis and many of them focused on particular services or geographies. We continue to\noptimize collaboration among our brands. As we manage this shift, in addition to managing any changes in our workforce, we may find it difficult to maintain the\nbeneficial aspects of our corporate culture at the brand companies and throughout the organization as a whole. In addition, any future expansion or shift increases\nthe complexity of our business and places additional strain on our management, operations, technical performance, financial resources, and administrative, legal,\ntax, internal controls, and financial reporting functions. Our current and planned employees and outsourced resources, systems, procedures, and controls may not\nbe adequate to support and effectively manage growth and increased complexity, or could result in actual or perceived disruption of our service or customer\nsupport, especially as we have employees and outsourced resources in multiple geographic locations around the world and increase the number and variety of our\nproducts and payment systems.\nIn addition, we are conducting a multi-year phased migration to integrate and upgrade certain systems and processes. The implementation of new\ninformation technology, payment, enterprise resource planning, or other systems is disruptive and costly and may not be successful, which could adversely affect\nour business and results of operations. For example, during a recent upgrade of certain financial systems, some of Booking.com's partners experienced delays in\nreceiving payment from us. Any failure to implement or adapt to new technologies in a timely manner or at all could adversely affect our ability to compete,\nincrease our consumer acquisition costs or otherwise adversely affect our business, brand, market share, reputation, or results of operations.\nInvestments in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated.\nWe have invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies and acquisitions of complementary businesses. Such endeavors may not be\nsuccessful. In 2023 our agreement to acquire European-based flights booking provider Etraveli Group was terminated after the European Commission blocked\nthe transaction. Additionally, such ventures may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including diversion of management's attention from current\noperations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, increased regulatory scrutiny, inadequate return on capital, new risks with which we are not familiar,\nlegal and compliance obligations that previously did not apply to us, integration risks, and unidentified issues not discovered in our evaluations of those strategies\nand acquisitions. Further, we may issue shares of our common stock in these transactions, which could result in dilution to our stockholders. As a result, entering\nnew businesses involves risks and costs that could, if realized, have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, profit margins, cash flows\nor financial condition, as well as on our ability to achieve the expected benefits of any such investments or acquisitions. In addition, we may decide to make\nminority investments, including through joint ventures, in which we have limited or no management or operational control.

Cyberattacks are increasing in frequency and sophistication and are constantly\nevolving. We may not be able to defend against sophisticated cyberattacks from determined adversaries. In addition, our security policies and controls may not\nkeep pace with the continuous innovation of our offerings.\nVulnerabilities in our consumer and partner account security and workflow practices could and have resulted in unauthorized access to personal and\nconfidential data. These risks are likely to increase as we expand our offerings, integrate our products and services, incorporate AI and Large Language Models,\nand store and process more data, including personal information and payment data. The disclosure of non-public Company-sensitive information by our\nworkforce or other parties could lead to information loss, reputational harm, or loss of a competitive advantage. We expend significant resources to protect\nagainst security breaches and maintain or increase our systems' security. We have experienced and responded to cyberattacks, which we believe have not had a\nmaterial impact on the integrity of our systems or the security of data, including personal information maintained by us. Security breaches could result in\nnegative publicity, damage our reputation, expose us to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability, subject us to regulatory penalties and sanctions, or cause\nconsumers to lose confidence in our security and choose to use the services of our competitors, any of which would have an adverse effect on our brands, market\nshare, results of operations, and financial condition.

These laws and their interpretations continue to develop\nand may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Additionally, some of these regulations, such as the CCPA, give consumers a private right of action\nagainst companies for violations of these rules. While we invest significant resources to comply with a growing patchwork of privacy regulations, many of these\nregulations (such as the Personal Information Protection Law in the People's Republic of China and the Digital Personal Data Protection Act in India) are\ncomplex to implement and subject to uncertain interpretation. Non-compliance with these laws could result in negative publicity, damage to our reputation,\nsignificant penalties, or other legal liability. If laws or regulations are expanded to require changes in our business practices, or interpreted in ways that\nnegatively affect our business, our results of operations, financial condition, or competitive position could be adversely affected.\nCyberattacks and system vulnerabilities could lead to sustained service outages, data loss, reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to\nour competitive position.\nIf our systems cannot cope with the level of demand required to service our consumers and partners, we could experience unanticipated disruptions in\nservice, slower response times, decreased customer service and customer satisfaction, and delays in the introduction of new services. As an online business, we\nare dependent on the internet, connectivity, and mobile systems throughout the world. Disruptions in internet access could materially adversely affect our\nbusiness and results of operations. While we maintain redundant systems and hosting services, they are not always sufficient to prevent disruption, and we do not\ncarry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may occur.\nWe have computer hardware for operating our services located in hosting facilities around the world. Although we have disaster recovery plans, these\nsystems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption and they may not cover us in every region. If such events were to occur, we may not be able to\nswitch to back-up systems immediately and it could result in lengthy interruptions or delays in our services. Any system failure that causes an interruption or\ndelay in service could impair our reputation, damage our brands, increase customer service costs, or result in lost business, any of which could adversely affect\nour business and results of operations. We seek to increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems. These steps are expensive, may reduce our margins, and\nmay not be successful in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime.\nWe have experienced targeted and organized malware, phishing, and account takeover attacks, and may in the future experience these and other forms of\nattack such as ransomware, SQL injection (where a third party attempts to insert malicious code into our software through data entry fields in our websites in\norder to gain control of the system), and attempts to use our websites as a platform to launch a denial-of-service attack on another party. Our existing security\nmeasures may not be successful in preventing attacks on our systems. For instance, we have incurred costs related to customer reimbursement and customer\nservice, reputational harm, and lost revenue from fictitious listings and partner account takeovers. Our existing IT business continuity and disaster recovery\npractices are less effective against certain types of attacks such as ransomware, which could result in interruption of our services, data exposure, and/or an\nextortion attempt. Reductions in the availability and response time of our online services could cause loss of substantial business volumes and measures we may\ntake to divert suspect traffic could result in the diversion of bona fide customers.

Any damage to, breach of, or interruption in these third-\nparty services and systems or deterioration in their performance could prevent us from booking related reservations and have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, brands, and results of operations. Third party business partners, service providers, and consultants may be given access to our computer networks. A\ncyberattack against one of these third parties that compromises their credentials may result in unauthorized access to our systems and data, resulting in a\ncyberattack against us.

A security breach at any third-party that we conduct business with, such as the security breach experienced\nby MGM Resorts International in 2023, could be perceived by consumers as a security breach of our systems and could result in negative publicity, subject us to\nnotification requirements, damage our reputation, expose us to risk of loss or litigation, and subject us to regulatory penalties and sanctions, even if we had no\ndirect involvement in the breach. In addition, such third parties may not comply with applicable disclosure requirements or with parameters within which we\npermit them to process data, which could expose us to liability.\nWe depend upon various third parties to process payments, including credit cards, or to provide credit card numbers for payment for our merchant\ntransactions. If any such third party were compromised or ceased or suspended operations, our cash flows could be disrupted or we may not be able to generate\nmerchant transactions (and related revenues) for a period of time and this could have a negative effect on our business, reputation, and results of operations and,\nin certain cases of the insolvency of such a partner could result in additional payments by us and loss of the total transaction value.\nTax Risks\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nAs an international business providing services around the world, we are subject to various taxes. Although we believe that our tax filing positions are\nreasonable and comply with applicable law, we regularly review them and we may change our positions or determine that previous positions should be amended,\neither of which could result in additional tax liabilities. The final determination of tax audits or disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical\ntax provisions and accruals. We have been audited in many taxing jurisdictions. If audits find that additional taxes are due, we may be subject to incremental tax\nliabilities, possibly including interest and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nAn unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending litigation or audit proceedings could encourage the commencement of additional litigation, audit proceedings,\nor other regulatory inquiries. See Notes 15 and 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding certain tax matters and tax\ncontingencies.\nGovernments are increasingly focused on ways to increase tax revenues, which has contributed to an increase in audit activity, more aggressive\npositions taken by tax authorities, more time and difficulty to resolve any audits or disputes, and an increase in new tax legislation.

Further, digital services\ntaxes may not apply to our competitors, which could harm our business and competitive position.\nAdditionally, there have been significant changes made and proposed to international tax laws that increase the complexity, burden, and cost of tax\ncompliance. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (\"OECD\") has been working on the \"base erosion and profit shifting\" (\"BEPS\")\nproject to ensure international tax standards keep pace with changes in global business practices. This project could change various aspects of the existing rules\nunder which our tax obligations are determined. In 2021, more than 130 countries agreed to a new OECD framework on BEPS that, among other provisions,\nincludes proposed changes to how the right to tax income would be allocated among countries and imposes a 15% global minimum tax. The OECD recently\nissued additional commentary related to the 15% minimum tax, including the intention that provisions be incorporated into law with an effective date of January\n1, 2024. Several member countries outside the U.S. have adopted these rules, effective January 1, 2024. The rules for the calculation of the 15% minimum tax are\ncomplex and additional guidance continues to be issued by the OECD and its member countries. The implementation of these rules could have a negative impact\non our results of operations or cash flows.\nDue to the large scale of our business activities outside of the United States, any changes in U.S. or international taxation of our activities, such as new\ndefinitions of permanent establishment, new nexus and profit allocation rules, or the combined effect of tax laws in multiple jurisdictions, may increase our\nworldwide effective tax rate, increase the complexity and costs associated with tax compliance, and adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nWe are also subject to other non-income-based taxes, such as value-added, payroll, sales, use, excise, net worth, property, hotel occupancy, and goods\nand services. We refer generally to taxes on travel transactions (e.g., value-added taxes, sales taxes, excise taxes, hotel occupancy taxes, etc.) as \"travel\ntransaction taxes.\" From time to time, we are under audit or investigation by tax authorities or involved in legal proceedings related to these non-income-based\ntaxes or we may revise our tax positions, which may result in additional non-income-based tax liabilities.\nA number of jurisdictions in the United States have initiated lawsuits or other proceedings against OTCs, including us, related to, among other things,\nthe payment of certain travel transaction taxes that could include historical taxes that are claimed to be owed, interest, penalties, punitive damages and/or\nattorney's fees and costs. Additional jurisdictions may assert that we are subject to travel transaction taxes and could seek to collect such taxes, either\nretroactively, prospectively or both.

However, Booking.com's application may not be accepted, or, if\naccepted, the amount of qualifying earnings may be reduced.\nThe loss of the Innovation Box Tax benefit (or any material portion thereof) could substantially increase our effective tax rate and adversely impact our\nresults of operations and cash flows in the future.\nLegal, Regulatory, Compliance, and Reputational Risks\nOur business is subject to various competition/anti-trust, consumer protection, and online commerce laws and regulations around the world, and as the\nsize of our business grows, scrutiny of our business by legislators and regulators in these areas may intensify.\nWe are subject to competition and consumer protection laws and regulations around the world. These laws and regulations constantly evolve, and their\ninterpretation, application, and enforcement can also change, be unpredictable, or be affected by changing political or social pressures. As we expand our\nbusiness into new areas, including our evolution towards the Connected Trip vision, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations. We have been the\nsubject of investigations or inquiries by national competition authorities (\"NCAs\") or other governmental authorities. For example, we are involved in\ninvestigations related to whether Booking.com's contractual parity arrangements with accommodation providers are anti-competitive because they require\npartners to provide Booking.com with rates, conditions, and availability at least as favorable as those offered to other OTCs or by the partner itself. Recently, the\nComisi\u00f3n Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia in Spain issued a draft decision to impose a fine and to restrict certain business practices based on the\nallegation that certain practices by Booking.com may produce adverse effects for hotels and other OTCs. Additionally, in September 2017 the Swiss Price\nSurveillance Office opened an investigation into the level of commissions of Booking.com in Switzerland. The Swiss investigation is ongoing and if there is an\nadverse outcome in the investigation and any appeal, Booking.com could be required to reduce its commissions in Switzerland. To resolve and close certain of\nthe investigations, we have made commitments to the investigating authorities regarding future business practices or activities, such as agreeing to narrow the\nscope of our parity arrangements. While we believe that we are complying with the commitments we have made, investigating authorities or third parties may\ndetermine otherwise and decide to pursue legal action to compel compliance or seek other remedies. We are cooperating with regulators where applicable, but we\nare unable to predict what, if any, effect any investigations or their resolution, including the effect of any commitments we might make, will have on our\nbusiness, industry practices, or online commerce more generally. An unfavorable outcome of an investigation could encourage additional regulatory inquiries that\ncould become widespread over time, significantly increasing the potential financial and reputational impact on the Company. Additionally, these types of\ninvestigations can result and have resulted in the assessment of fines, private litigation, and negative publicity. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial\nStatements for more information regarding our contingencies.\nWe have also been involved in investigations or inquiries involving consumer protection matters and we have previously made certain voluntary\ncommitments to consumer authorities to resolve investigations or inquiries that have included showing prices inclusive of all mandatory taxes and charges,\nproviding information about the effect of money earned on search result rankings on or before the search results page, and making certain adjustments to how\ndiscounts and statements concerning popularity or availability are shown to consumers. To the extent that these or any other investigations or inquiries result in\nadditional commitments, changes to our business practices, negative publicity, fines, damages from private litigation, or other remedies, it could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThere is significant legislative and public focus on the technology industry, especially as technology companies become larger. In some instances,\ncountries have passed legislation that goes further to restrict business activities than actions taken by NCAs or other regulatory authorities.

In some of our contracts, we or the other party have agreed to bidding\nrestrictions. If bidding restrictions are held to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable or if we remove them from all of our contracts, it could negatively impact our\nperformance marketing efficiency, business, and results of operations.\nRegulatory and legal requirements and uncertainties could subject us to business constraints, increased compliance costs and complexities, or\notherwise harm our business.\nLegal requirements of governments and regulatory authorities, many of which are evolving and subject to revised interpretations, impact our ability to\nprovide our services and can result in private litigation. For example, we currently offer optional rental car-related insurance products to customers protecting\nthem against accidental damage to their rental vehicles, optional room and flight cancellation insurance products, and we intend to offer additional trip-related\ninsurance products in the future, which subjects us to certain insurance distribution regulations and related increased compliance costs and complexities, any of\nwhich could negatively impact our business and results of operations.

In addition, as our payment processing activities continue to develop, we expect to be subject to additional regulations, including financial services\nregulations, which we expect to result in increased compliance costs and complexities, including those associated with the implementation of new or advanced\ninternal controls, including, by way of example, those arising from the E.U.'s Payment Services Directive 2 and similar or successor legislation. The\nimplementation of these processes may result in increased compliance costs and administrative burdens.\nRegulators (or we) may determine, and in some cases are likely to determine, that certain aspects of our business are subject to laws that govern\npayments activities, such as money transmission and online payments processing, which could require us to obtain licenses to continue to operate in certain\njurisdictions or result in modification of our business plans. Certain of our subsidiaries that may provide payment services in support of our brands are subject to\nlicensing and regulations that impose notice and approval obligations on investors that seek indirect or direct ownership, in the aggregate, of 10% or more of our\noutstanding shares. Regulations relating to operational resilience, banking (including consumer protection), privacy, and security of our processes also apply to\nus. Further, our payments systems are susceptible to illegal and improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, fraudulent sales of goods or\nservices, and transactions by or with sanctioned parties. We have invested and will need to continue to invest substantial resources to comply with applicable\nlaws and regulations, and failure to maintain compliance could lead to fines or require us to modify or interrupt our business practices, plans, or operations, any\nof which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and profit margins.\nWe are also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under our contracts with the card schemes and our payment card processors, and\nindirectly to the rules of payment systems in respect of credit (i.e., account to account) transfers. The rules of the card schemes and payment systems are often\nupdated or interpreted by the schemes in different ways, and we may need to adjust our systems and/or processes to comply with any updated obligations. If we\nfail to comply with such obligations, we may lose our ability to accept certain credit and debit card payments from our customers, or facilitate other types of\nonline payments, which would negatively impact our business and operating results. Under card association rules, including the Payment Card Industry Data\nSecurity Standard (the \"Standard\"), if information is compromised, we could be liable to payment card issuers for associated expenses and penalties, and in some\ncases, we could be restricted in our ability to accept payment cards. Under certain circumstances in our agreements with the card schemes and in relation to the\nStandard, we are also subject to periodic audits, self-assessments, and other assessments of our compliance with the rules and obligations of the payment card\nassociations and the Standard, which could result in additional expenses and administrative burdens. In addition, if we fail to follow payment card industry\nsecurity standards, even if no consumer information is compromised, we could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card\ntransaction costs. Additionally, compliance with the Standard may not prevent all security incidents.

Authorities may assert, and in some cases are likely to determine, that our collection, use, or\nmanagement of customer and other data is inconsistent with laws and regulations, including laws that apply to cookies or similar technology, and there may be\nsignificant penalties for non-compliance. In the EU, the ePrivacy Directive is implemented in national laws as a result of which different interpretations and\nrequirements apply on a country by country basis. EU regulators continue to issue guidance concerning the ePrivacy Directive's requirements regarding the use\nof cookies and similar technologies and may impose specific measures which could impact our use of such technologies. In addition, the ePrivacy Directive and\nnational implementation laws impose additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and include significant penalties for non-compliance. In\nthe U.S., disclosure requirements and limitations may apply to the use of certain cookies and other online tracking technologies deemed to be sales of personal\ninformation under the CCPA or other state laws. If these privacy-driven initiatives or regulations impair our ability to serve customers optimally or if we are less\neffective than our competitors in addressing these issues, our ability to improve performance on our platforms, business, market share, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected. Further, any failure to comply with evolving privacy regulations, guidance, and interpretations could result in significant fines,\ngovernment enforcement actions, private litigation, and harm to our business, results of operations, or reputation.\nFinancial Risks\nOur liquidity, credit ratings, and ongoing access to capital could be materially and negatively affected by global financial conditions and events.\nOur continued access to sources of liquidity depends on multiple factors, including global economic conditions, the condition of global financial\nmarkets, the availability of sufficient amounts of financing, our ability to meet debt covenant requirements, our operating performance, and our credit ratings.\nIncreased volatility in the financial and securities markets in recent years has generally made access to capital less certain. Further, if our credit ratings were to be\ndowngraded or if financing sources were to ascribe higher risk to our rating levels, our industry or us, our access to capital, and the cost of any financing would\nbe negatively impacted. We currently have $2 billion available under our revolving credit facility, which contains certain financial covenants that we need to\ncomply with in order to access such liquidity. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the covenant requirements at any particular time. Further,\nthe lenders have the right to require repayment of any amounts borrowed under the facility if we are not in compliance.\nThere is no guarantee that additional debt financing will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms or at all, in which case we may\nneed to seek other sources of funding. In addition, the terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants, which could restrict our business\noperations.

Such sales could cause the market price of our common\nstock to decline significantly. In addition, fluctuations in our stock price and our price-to-earnings multiple may have made or may make our stock attractive to\nmomentum, hedge, or day-trading investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction.\nThe trading prices of technology company stocks in general, including ours, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations.

Further, our ability to liquidate any such investments is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering\nor acquisition, as no public market exists for such securities.

Cybersecurity\n    We are dedicated to upholding our commitment to our customers, partners, and employees to manage cybersecurity, privacy, and data protection and security\nrisk. Our approach involves various tools, processes, technologies, and controls to identify and manage such risks.\nRisk Management and Strategy\nIdentifying, assessing, and managing cybersecurity risk is generally integrated into our overall risk management systems and processes. The Company's\ninternal audit function, with primary oversight by the Audit Committee, assesses key risks facing the organization across functions and regions. These risks are\nreviewed and discussed by the Company's management-level risk committee, which is a multi-disciplinary committee including representation from senior\nmanagement in the finance, internal audit, and legal functions, among others. The risk committee is tasked with ensuring risks, including those related to\ncybersecurity, are managed and aligning strategic objectives with an appropriate level of risk tolerance.\nOur Cyber Risk Management Policy establishes the framework for our cybersecurity risk management and governance. Our security teams\noperationalize the Policy across the Company and conduct cyber risk identification, assessment, management, monitoring, tracking, and reporting. Our privacy\nprogram is built upon the privacy principles of transparency, purpose, control, security, embedded privacy, and accountability. Our privacy teams are responsible\nfor identifying, managing, and reporting on data protection risks. We leverage the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) frameworks for\ncybersecurity and privacy. The NIST frameworks help us to align our security and privacy functions and provide a risk management approach across the\nCompany. We annually measure our security and privacy program maturity against these frameworks, and engage a third party every other year to assess the\ncurrent state against these frameworks. The results of these assessments are discussed with the Board and the Cybersecurity Subcommittee of the Audit\nCommittee.

These teams have established procedures for detecting, managing, and remediating cybersecurity incidents, and\nprocesses for personnel to escalate incidents within the organization. A cross-functional working group of security, privacy, and legal personnel review\nsignificant incidents to determine if further escalation is appropriate. If an incident could be deemed material, it is escalated, and we consult with outside counsel\nduring this assessment as appropriate.\nOur internal audit function collaborates with the security teams to participate in an integrated cybersecurity assurance program. The internal audit\nfunction also performs its own cybersecurity audits and reviews certain cybersecurity-related practices, such as access controls, as part of their assessment of our\ninternal control over financial reporting. From time to time we have taken steps to improve our practices and remedy deficiencies that have been identified. Our\nenterprise-wide information security program is also independently assessed every other year by a third party as part of our enterprise risk management, and our\nCybersecurity Subcommittee reviews the assessment findings.

We also depend upon various third parties to process payments for our\ntransactions around the world. These third party business partners, service providers, and consultants need to access our customer and other data, and connect to\nour computer networks. We define expected security and privacy requirements through our contracting processes with third parties and we perform third-party\ncyber risk assessments to monitor the cyber risk management efforts of third parties as needed.\nAlthough we expend significant resources to protect against security breaches, our existing security measures may not be successful in preventing all\nattacks on our systems.

The Cybersecurity Subcommittee oversees\nmanagement's efforts and processes to identify, assess, manage, and monitor significant cybersecurity and privacy risks and regulatory developments in this area.\nOur cybersecurity and privacy leaders meet with the Cybersecurity Subcommittee to discuss the Company's cybersecurity and data protection risk exposures,\nincluding the steps management has taken to monitor and manage such exposures and their potential impact on the Company's business, operations, and\nreputation. The Cybersecurity Subcommittee reports periodically on these matters to the Audit Committee and Board.\nThe individuals serving in the roles of chief security officer and chief privacy officer have enterprise-wide responsibility for assessing and managing\ncybersecurity, data protection and security, and privacy risks, respectively.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes.\nWe evaluate certain operating and financial measures on both an as-reported and constant-currency basis. We calculate constant currency by\nconverting our current year operating and financial results for transactions recorded in currencies other than U.S. Dollars using the corresponding prior\nyear monthly average exchange rates rather than the current year monthly average exchange rates. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations impacted our year-\nover-year growth in gross bookings, revenues, and operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. Since our expenses are generally\ndenominated in foreign currencies on a basis similar to our revenues, our operating margins have not been significantly impacted by currency fluctuations.\nOverview\nOur mission is to make it easier for everyone to experience the world. We aim to provide consumers with a best-in-class experience offering the travel\nchoices they want, with tailored language, payment, and other options, seamlessly connecting them with our travel service provider partners. We offer these\nservices through five primary consumer-facing brands: Booking.com, Priceline, Agoda, KAYAK, and OpenTable. See Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial\nStatements for information on our operating segments. See Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to revenue by geographic\narea.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenues from enabling consumers to make travel service reservations. We also earn revenues from advertising\nservices, restaurant reservations and restaurant management services, and other services, such as travel-related insurance services.\nTrends\nSince the second quarter of 2020 and through 2023, changes in accommodation room nights versus the comparable period in 2019 have generally\nimproved as government-imposed travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic have eased and consumer demand for travel has improved. In 2022, global\nroom nights were 52% higher than in 2021 and 6% higher than in 2019. The year-over-year growth in room nights in 2022 was driven primarily by the recovery\nin Europe, Asia, and Rest of World, as well as by growth in North America. In 2023, global room nights increased 17% year-over-year driven primarily by the\ncontinued recovery in Asia and strong travel demand in Europe. Our global room nights in 2023 were up about 24% versus 2019. In 2023, we saw the booking\nwindow expand compared to 2022, which benefited year-over-year room night growth in 2023.\nIn March 2022, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, we suspended the booking of travel services in Russia and Belarus. This led to the loss of new\nbookings from bookers in these countries. Excluding room nights from bookers in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus in each comparable period, our overall room\nnights in 2023 were up about 17% versus 2022 and up about 29% versus 2019.\nWe saw a negative impact on room night growth in the fourth quarter of 2023 due to the Israel-Hamas war, particularly in Israel. In the fourth quarter of\n2023, global room nights increased 9% year-over-year. Excluding room nights for bookers going to and from Israel, our overall room nights were up 11% year-\nover-year. There was also some impact on travel trends outside of the country, such as cancellations and a drop in new bookings. If the conflict continues or\nexpands, it may adversely affect demand for our services, particularly in nearby areas.\n33", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3659, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fbea08c4-11b9-4158-a0d9-0c508f3fe823": {"__data__": {"id_": "fbea08c4-11b9-4158-a0d9-0c508f3fe823", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9b305705-cce3-4c62-9aa3-ab30320a0a8e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "4d180b9132f2e53b5300effd0b7628d579b2a5e499847682ea4786d06aac63a4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Quarterly Room Nights and Change versus the prior year and 2019\n34", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 66, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "49284ed7-91ac-4d4a-8693-cd7321b01557": {"__data__": {"id_": "49284ed7-91ac-4d4a-8693-cd7321b01557", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7b8e952c-88b0-4937-8f47-15a81f5f6875", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "c6cac3fc13ff7469d73e7905e7279baca623c85e4cb6927f03bdcd4e8ea19b75", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cc7d4510-23d7-4e6e-8b57-7b514d93c4ec", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0b0ab5cac7bd26ae65432eb2ed30b4ece917a17f6623ea2c3cc3ffdadedb1c5d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The cancellation rate in 2023 was in line with the prior year. We have observed a general improvement in cancellation rates in recent years, though we\nhave seen periods of elevated cancellation rates from time to time. Because we recognize revenue from bookings when the traveler checks in, our reported\nrevenue is not at risk of being reversed due to cancellations. Increases in cancellation rates can negatively impact our marketing efficiency as a result of incurring\nperformance marketing expense at the time a booking is made even though that booking could be canceled in the future if it was booked under a flexible\ncancellation policy. There are many factors in addition to cancellation rates that contribute to marketing efficiency including average daily rates (\"ADRs\"), costs\nper click, foreign currency exchange rates, our ability to convert paid traffic to bookings, the timing and effectiveness of our brand marketing campaigns, and the\nextent to which consumers come directly to our platforms for bookings.\nThe mix of our room nights booked for international travel in 2023 was approximately 52%, up versus approximately 46% in 2022 due in part to\ngovernment-imposed limitations on international travel (travelers booking a stay at a property located outside their own country) in some parts of the world in\n2022.\nThe mix of our room nights booked on a mobile device (including room nights booked on a mobile app or via a mobile website) in 2023 increased\ncompared to 2022. The revenue earned on a transaction from a mobile device may be less than a typical desktop transaction as we see different consumer\npurchasing patterns across devices. For example, accommodation reservations made on a mobile device typically are for shorter lengths of stay and have lower\naccommodation ADRs. The mix of our room nights booked on a mobile app in 2023 was approximately 49%, up versus approximately 44% in 2022. We\ncontinue to see favorable repeat direct booking behavior from consumers in our mobile apps, which allow us more opportunities to engage directly with\nconsumers.\nOur global ADRs increased approximately 6% on a constant currency basis in 2023 as compared to 2022, driven primarily by higher ADRs in Europe\nand Asia. The increase in our global ADRs in 2023 as compared to 2022, was negatively impacted by approximately three percentage points from changes in\ngeographical mix in our business driven primarily by a higher mix of room nights from Asia, which is a lower ADR region, and a lower mix of room nights from\nNorth America, which is a higher ADR region. The year-over-year increase in our global ADRs has resulted in our accommodation gross bookings growing faster\nthan our room nights in 2023. It is difficult to predict what the trend in industry ADRs will look like going forward.\nWe focus on relentless innovation to grow our business by providing a best-in-class user experience with intuitive, easy-to-use online platforms that aim\nto exceed the expectations of online consumers. We have a long-term strategy to create an ideal traveler experience, offering our customers relevant options and\nconnections at the times and in the language they want them, making trips booked with us seamless, easy, and valuable. We refer to this as the \"Connected Trip.\"\nThe goal of our Connected Trip vision is to offer a differentiated and personalized online travel planning, booking, payment, and in-trip experience for each trip,\nenhanced by a robust loyalty program that provides value to travelers and partners across all trips. We expect these efforts to benefit our revenue growth over\ntime, however, to the extent our non-accommodation services (e.g., airline ticket reservation services) have lower margins and increase as a percentage of our\ntotal business, our operating margins may be negatively affected.\nAs part of our strategy to provide more payment options to consumers and travel service providers, increase the number and variety of our\naccommodations, and enable our long-term Connected Trip strategy, Booking.com increasingly processes transactions on a merchant basis, where it facilitates\npayments from travelers for the services provided. This allows Booking.com to process transactions for travel service providers and to increase its ability to offer\nsecure and flexible transaction terms to consumers, such as the form and timing of payment. We believe that expanding these types of service offerings will\nbenefit consumers and travel service providers, as well as our gross bookings, room night, and earnings growth rates.

Our brand marketing expense is primarily related to costs associated with producing and airing\ndigital branding and television advertising.\nMarketing efficiency, expressed as marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings, and performance marketing ROIs are impacted by a number of\nfactors that are subject to variability and are in some cases outside of our control, including ADRs, costs per click, cancellation rates, foreign currency exchange\nrates, our ability to convert paid traffic to booking customers, and the timing and effectiveness of our brand marketing campaigns. In recent years, we observed\nperiods of stable or increasing ROIs. Although it is difficult to predict how performance marketing ROIs will change in the future, ROIs could be negatively\nimpacted by increased levels of competition and other factors. When evaluating our performance marketing spend, we typically consider several factors for each\nchannel, such as the customer experience on the advertising platform, the incremental traffic we receive, and anticipated repeat rates. Marketing efficiency can\nalso be impacted by the extent to which consumers come directly to our platforms for bookings. Marketing expenses as a percentage of total gross bookings in\n2023 were lower than in 2022 due to higher performance marketing ROIs and an increase in the share of room nights booked by consumers coming directly to\nour platforms. Performance marketing ROIs were higher in 2023 versus 2022 due in part to our ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of our marketing spend.\nSee Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - \"We face risks relating to our marketing efforts.\" and \"We are dependent on travel service providers, restaurants, search\nplatforms, and other third parties.\"\nBooking.com had approximately 3.4 million properties on its website at December 31, 2023, consisting of over 475,000 hotels, motels, and resorts and\nover 2.9 million alternative accommodation properties (including homes, apartments, and other unique places to stay), representing an increase from over 2.7\nmillion properties at December 31, 2022. The year-over-year increase in total properties was driven primarily by an increase in alternative accommodation\nproperties.\nThe mix of Booking.com's room nights booked for alternative accommodation properties in 2023 was approximately 33%, up versus approximately\n30% in 2022. We have observed a longer-term trend of an increasing mix of room nights booked for alternative accommodation properties as consumer demand\nfor these types of properties has grown, and as we have increased the number and variety of them on Booking.com. We may experience lower profit margins due\nto additional costs, such as increased customer service or certain partner related costs, related to offering alternative accommodations on our platforms. As our\nalternative accommodation business has grown, these different characteristics have negatively impacted our profit margins and this trend may continue.\nAlthough we believe that providing an extensive collection of properties, excellent customer service, and an intuitive, easy-to-use consumer experience\nare important factors influencing a consumer's decision to make a reservation, for many consumers, the price of the travel service is the primary factor\ndetermining whether a consumer will book. Discounting and couponing (i.e., merchandising) occurs across all of the major regions in which we operate,\nparticularly in Asia. In some cases, our competitors are willing to make little or no profit on a transaction or offer travel services at a loss in order to gain market\nshare. As a result, it is increasingly important to offer travel services, such as accommodation reservations, at a competitive price, whether through discounts,\ncoupons, closed-user group rates or loyalty programs, increased flexibility in cancellation policies, or otherwise. These initiatives have resulted and, in the future,\nmay result in lower ADRs and lower revenue as a percentage of gross bookings.

As a result of the movements in foreign currency exchange rates, both the absolute amounts of and percentage changes\nin our foreign-currency-denominated net assets, gross bookings, revenues, operating expenses, and net income as expressed in U.S. Dollars are affected.

Since our expenses are generally denominated in foreign currencies\non a basis similar to our revenues, our operating margins have not been significantly impacted by currency fluctuations. We generally enter into derivative\ninstruments to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposure to the\nimpact of movements in foreign currency exchange rates on our transactional balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. See Note 6\nto our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our derivative contracts.

Our significant accounting\npolicies and estimates are more fully described in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting estimates are particularly important\nto our financial position and results of operations and require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of\nmatters that are inherently uncertain. We use our judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates and we\nevaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. Estimates are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the travel\nindustry, and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different\nassumptions or conditions. Matters that involve significant estimates and judgments of management include the valuation of investments in private companies,\nthe valuation of goodwill and other long-lived assets, income taxes, and contingencies.\nValuation of Investments in Private Companies\nSee Notes 2, 5, and 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the investments in private companies and\ninformation on fair value measurements, including the three levels of inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value. When inputs that are\nobservable, either directly or indirectly (observable market data), are available at the measurement date and are not significantly adjusted using unobservable\ninputs, the observable inputs would be classified as Level 2 inputs. When little or no market data is available, the fair value of these investments are measured\nusing unobservable inputs (\"Level 3 inputs\").\nOur investments measured using Level 3 inputs primarily consist of investments in privately-held companies that were classified as either debt\nsecurities or equity securities without readily determinable fair values. Fair values of privately held securities are estimated using a variety of valuation\nmethodologies, including both market and income approaches. We use valuation techniques appropriate for the type of investment and the information available\nabout the investee as of the valuation date to determine fair value. Recent financing transactions in the investee are generally considered the best indication of the\nenterprise value and therefore used as a basis to estimate fair value. However, based on a number of factors, such as the proximity to the valuation date or the\nvolume or other terms of these financing transactions, we may also use other valuation techniques to supplement this data, including the income approach. When\na financing transaction occurs and represents fair value, we also use the calibration process, as appropriate, when estimating fair value on subsequent\nmeasurement dates. Calibration is the process of using observed transactions in the investee company's own instruments to ensure that the valuation techniques\nthat will be employed to value the investee company investment on subsequent measurement dates begin with assumptions that are consistent with the original\nobserved transaction as well as any more recent observed transactions in the instruments issued by the investee company.\nOur investments in equity securities of private companies at December 31, 2023 and 2022, include $51 million originally invested in Yanolja Co., Ltd.\n(\"Yanolja\"). In July 2021, Yanolja announced a new round of funding which was completed in October 2021 along with certain other transactions. As a result of\nthese observable transactions, we increased the carrying value of our investment in Yanolja to $306 million as of December 31, 2021. As of June 30, 2023 and\n2022, we evaluated our investment in Yanolja for impairment using a combination of the market approach and the income approach in estimating the fair value of\nour investment as of those dates, and recognized impairment charges of $24 million and $184 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively (see Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).

It requires\nsignificant judgments and estimates and actual results could be materially different than those judgments and estimates utilized in the fair value estimate. Future\nevents and changing market conditions may lead us to re-evaluate the assumptions reflected in the valuation, which may result in a need to recognize additional\nimpairment charges.\nValuation of Goodwill and other Long-lived Assets\nThe application of the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions to\ndetermine the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Our estimates of the fair value are based upon assumptions that we believe are reasonable.\nWhen we deem appropriate, we utilize assistance from third-party valuation firms. The consideration transferred is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed based on their respective values at the acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred over the net of the amounts allocated to the\nidentifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units that are expected to benefit from the\nsynergies of the business combination.\nA substantial portion of our intangible assets and goodwill relates to the acquisitions of OpenTable, KAYAK, and Getaroom. See Note 18 to our\nConsolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the acquisition of Getaroom in December 2021.\nWe review long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The\nassessment of possible impairment is based upon the ability to recover the carrying value of the assets from the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows,\nbefore interest and taxes, of the related asset group.\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not\nreduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. We test goodwill at a reporting unit level and our annual goodwill impairment tests are\nperformed as of September 30. As of September 30, 2023, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and concluded that there was no impairment of\ngoodwill.    \nThe estimation of fair values of our reporting units reflect numerous assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including key\nassumptions regarding each reporting unit's expected growth rates and operating margin and the competitive environment, as well as other key assumptions with\nrespect to matters outside of our control, such as discount rates and market comparables. Generally, changes in the assumptions used for comparable company\nmultiples would result in directionally similar changes in the fair value and changes in the assumptions used for discount rates would result in directionally\nopposite changes in the fair value. The estimation of fair value requires significant judgments and estimates and actual results could be materially different than\nthe judgments and estimates used. During 2022 and part of 2023, there have been significant adverse changes in the market valuation of companies in the travel\nand technology industries. Discount rates have also been impacted during those periods due to rising interest rates and adverse changes in the macroeconomic\nenvironment. Future events and changing market conditions, including economic uncertainties such as inflation, rising interest rates and risks of a potential\nrecession, may lead us to re-evaluate the assumptions used to estimate the fair values of our reporting units, which may result in a need to recognize additional\ngoodwill impairment charges that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIncome Taxes\nWe determine our tax expense based on our income and statutory tax rates applicable in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Due to the complex and\ndynamic nature of tax legislation, significant judgment is required in computing our tax expense and determining our tax positions. The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs\nAct (the \"Tax Act\") enacted in December 2017 made significant changes to U.S. federal tax law, including a one-time deemed repatriation tax imposed on\naccumulated unremitted international earnings, to be paid over eight years. We do not intend to indefinitely reinvest our international earnings that were subject\nto U.S. taxation pursuant to the mandatory deemed repatriation or subject to U.S. taxation as global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\").\n39", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5262, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "44a29bf2-3e29-40ac-a971-fe98949dad99": {"__data__": {"id_": "44a29bf2-3e29-40ac-a971-fe98949dad99", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "14128a14-f3f0-4dc7-84fe-b4808e17825d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "10bd7afd30e40dd44cad00f0a5bab83ff6eb7381a9eb41f672efabffaf817b3a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of\nthe reversals of temporary differences, and tax planning strategies and record valuation allowances as required.\nWe are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions. We face challenges regarding the amount of taxes due from time to\ntime. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions on our tax returns. Although we believe that our tax filing positions are\nreasonable and comply with applicable law, we regularly review our tax filing positions, especially in light of tax law or business practice changes, and we may\nchange our positions or determine that previous positions should be amended, either of which could result in changes to our tax liabilities. The final\ndetermination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals.\nThe evaluation of tax positions and recognition of income tax benefits require significant judgment and we consult with external tax and legal counsel as\nappropriate. We consider the technical merits of our tax positions along with the applicable tax statutes, related interpretations and precedents, and our\nexpectation of the outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with tax authorities. We recognize liabilities when we believe that uncertain positions may not be\nfully sustained upon audit by the tax authorities, including any related appeals or litigation processes. Liabilities recognized for uncertain tax positions are based\non a two-step approach for recognition and measurement. First, we evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence\nindicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based on its technical merits. Second, we measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that\nis more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Interest and penalties attributable to uncertain tax positions, if any, are recognized as a\ncomponent of income tax expense. The tax benefits ultimately realized by us may be different than what is recorded in the financial statements due to future\nevents such as our settling the matter with the tax authorities and our success in sustaining our tax positions.\nSee Notes 15 and 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nContingencies\nLoss contingencies (other than income tax-related contingencies disclosed above) arise from actual or possible claims and assessments and pending or\nthreatened litigation that may be brought against us. Based on our assessment of loss contingencies at each balance sheet date, a loss is recorded in the financial\nstatements if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. If the amount\nof the loss cannot be reasonably estimated, we disclose information about the contingency in the financial statements. We also disclose information in our\nfinancial statements about reasonably possible loss contingencies.\nThe determination of whether a loss is probable and whether the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated requires significant judgment and\nevaluation of all the underlying facts and circumstances including judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants, regulatory authorities, and\ncourts. Claims, assessments, and litigations involve significant uncertainties such as the complexity of the facts, the legal theories involved, the nature of the\nclaims, the judgment of the courts, the applicable methodology for determining potential damages, and, in the case of class actions, whether a class action can be\ncertified and the extent to which members of a class would or would not file a claim.\nOn a quarterly basis, we update our analysis and estimates considering all available information, including the impact of negotiations, settlements,\nrulings, and advice of legal counsel. Changes in our assessment of whether a loss is probable, our estimate of the loss, or our determination of whether the\namount of loss can be reasonably estimated could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Changes in our assumptions\nregarding a particular matter or the effectiveness of our strategies related to legal and other proceedings could also have a material impact on our results of\noperations and financial position.

The revolving credit facility extends a revolving\nline of credit up to $2 billion to us and provides for the issuance of up to $80 million of letters of credit, as well as up to $100 million of borrowings on same-day\nnotice. The revolving credit facility contains a maximum leverage ratio covenant, compliance with which is a condition to our ability to borrow. Upon entering\ninto this new revolving credit facility, we terminated the $2 billion five-year revolving credit facility entered into in August 2019. At December 31, 2023 there\nwere no borrowings outstanding and $18 million of letters of credit issued under the new revolving credit facility.\nSee Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our debt arrangements, including principal amounts, interest\nrates, and maturity dates.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n \nWe have exposure to several types of market risk: changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity prices.\nWe manage our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed\nappropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use foreign currency exchange derivative contracts to manage short-term foreign currency\nrisk.\nThe objective of our policies is to mitigate potential income statement, cash flow, and fair value exposures resulting from possible future adverse\nfluctuations in rates. We evaluate our exposure to market risk by assessing the anticipated near-term and long-term fluctuations in interest rates and foreign\ncurrency exchange rates. This evaluation includes the review of leading market indicators, discussions with financial analysts and investment bankers regarding\ncurrent and future economic conditions, and the review of market projections as to expected future rates. We utilize this information to determine our own\ninvestment strategies as well as to determine if the use of derivative financial instruments is appropriate to mitigate any potential future market exposure that we\nmay face. Our policy does not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or, except in certain limited situations, execution of derivative instrument\ncontracts for which there are no underlying exposures. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives.\nTo the extent that changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates affect general economic conditions, we would also be affected by such changes.\nSee Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our convertible senior notes and other debt. Excluding the effect on the fair\nvalue of our convertible senior notes, a hypothetical 100 basis point (1.0%) decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an increase in the estimated fair\nvalue of our other debt of approximately $612 million and $522 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our convertible senior notes are more\nsensitive to the equity market price volatility of our shares than changes in interest rates.

For example, our total gross bookings increased by 24% in 2023 as compared to 2022, but without the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange\nrates our total gross bookings increased year-over-year on a constant-currency basis by approximately 25%. Our total revenues increased by 56% for the year\nended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, but without the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, our total\nrevenues increased year-over-year on a constant-currency basis by approximately 71%.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information about foreign currency transaction\ngains and losses, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the impact of such changes on the increase in our revenues and operating margins, our use of\nforeign currency exchange derivatives, and our designation of certain portions of our Euro-denominated debt as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of the\nnet investment in certain Euro functional currency subsidiaries. We generally enter into foreign currency exchange derivatives to hedge our exposure to the\nimpact of movements in foreign currency exchange rates on our transactional balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. We will\ncontinue to evaluate the use of derivative instruments in the future. We also designate certain portions of the aggregate principal value of our Euro-denominated\ndebt as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of the net investment in certain Euro functional currency subsidiaries. Foreign currency transaction gains or\nlosses are dependent on the amount of net assets of the Euro functional currency subsidiaries, the amount of the Euro-denominated debt that is designated as a\nhedge, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nSee Notes 5 and 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our investments in equity securities of publicly-traded companies and\nprivate companies. We are exposed to equity price risk as it relates to changes in fair values of these investments. Our investments in private companies are\nmeasured at cost less impairment, if any. Such investments are also required to be measured at fair value as of the date of certain observable transactions for the\nidentical or a similar investment of the same issuer. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the fair values at December 31, 2023 and 2022 of our investments in equity\nsecurities of publicly-traded companies and private companies would have resulted in a loss, before tax, of approximately $45 million and $220 million,\nrespectively, being recognized in net income.\nItem 8.

In 2022, we began a multi-year implementation to integrate and upgrade certain financial systems and processes,\nincluding SAP S4 HANA (\"SAP\").\nAs a result of these improvements, there were changes to our internal control over financial reporting processes and procedures. However, there were no\nchanges in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) that occurred during the three months ended\nDecember 31, 2023 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Further, as the phased\nimplementation of SAP continues, there will be additional changes to our processes and procedures that are likely to impact our internal control over financial\nreporting. We believe we are taking the necessary steps to monitor and maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting during this period of change.\nWhile we expect this implementation to strengthen our internal financial controls by automating certain manual processes and standardizing business\nprocesses and reporting across our organization, management will continue to evaluate and monitor our internal controls as the implementation continues.\n58", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1918, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "99600bec-d251-4758-81a6-1387984f9504": {"__data__": {"id_": "99600bec-d251-4758-81a6-1387984f9504", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "55ae5456-5c7f-470f-8db5-feff7cc64453", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "59ffa33d07dcf08a779e949c06d9dec87df40d30e428a0f37213b0c8a0c6f44c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n \nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Booking Holdings Inc.\n \nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Booking Holdings Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2023, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n(COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial\nstatements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, of the Company and our report dated February 22, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those\nfinancial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of\ninternal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying \"Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\". Our responsibility\nis to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the\nPCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding\nof internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of\ninternal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit\nprovides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nStamford, Connecticut\nFebruary 22, 2024\n59", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4050, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "23f43555-80ec-4729-8b39-5a6e2205c860": {"__data__": {"id_": "23f43555-80ec-4729-8b39-5a6e2205c860", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ea142343-2d88-4dc5-b982-8d2460366f84", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "5e1cb2e70615c02da26ba27195854b14e7d5fd6bd0a99db5d404c4d8f5973a83", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Item 9B.

In our\nopinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results\nof its operations and its cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 22, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the\nCompany's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial\nstatements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating\nthe accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required\nto be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial\nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on\nthe accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nRevenue - Refer to Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s revenue is generated by providing online travel reservation services, which principally allow travelers to book travel\nreservations with travel service providers through the Company\u2019s platforms. Revenue consists of a significant volume of low-dollar transactions utilizing\nmultiple custom systems.\nWe identified revenue as a critical audit matter as the majority of the processes to calculate and record revenue are highly automated, rely on a number of custom\nsystems, and involve interfacing significant volumes of data across multiple systems. Given the complex information technology (IT) environment, this required\nthe involvement of professionals with expertise in IT to identify, test, and evaluate the revenue data flows, the revenue systems and the automated controls.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the Company's revenue transactions included the following, among others:\n\u2022With the assistance of our IT specialists, we:\n\u2013Identified the systems used to calculate and record revenue transactions.\n69", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4731, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b2ad7a06-c551-459a-bd6c-e4c12080d5c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "b2ad7a06-c551-459a-bd6c-e4c12080d5c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "72", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1878cbfe-2191-4975-a08d-6137dd8fc69b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "72", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "2d10eeb520b720c24307a47b2337468f141bd2ce9e3456cd39d9ea59a4fb7e0c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\u2013Tested the general IT controls over each of these systems, including testing of user access controls, change management controls, and IT operations\ncontrols.\n\u2013Performed testing of system interface controls and automated controls within the relevant revenue streams.\n\u2022We tested business process controls to reconcile the various systems to the Company's general ledgers.\n\u2022We performed detail transaction testing by agreeing the amounts recognized to source documents and testing the mathematical accuracy of the recorded\nrevenue.\nGoodwill - Refer to Notes 2 and 11 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company's evaluation of goodwill impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each of the Company's reporting units to its carrying value. As it\nrelated to the annual impairment test, the Company estimated the fair values using a combination of standard valuation techniques, including an income approach\n(discounted cash flows) and market approaches (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (\"EBITDA\") multiples of comparable publicly\ntraded companies). With respect to the income approach, management makes significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future performance,\nincluding revenues, operating margins, and discount rates.\nGiven the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value of the OpenTable and KAYAK reporting unit, performing audit procedures to\nevaluate the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions related to selection of the discount rates and forecasts of future revenues and operating\nmargins required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the forecasts of future revenues and operating margins and the selection of the discount rates for the OpenTable and KAYAK\nreporting unit included the following, among others:\n\u2022We tested the effectiveness of controls over goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over the forecasts and the selection of the discount rates.\n\u2022We evaluated management's ability to accurately forecast by comparing actual results in previous years to management\u2019s historical forecasts.\n\u2022We evaluated the reasonableness of management\u2019s forecasts of future revenues and operating margins by comparing management\u2019s forecasts with:\n\u2013Historical revenues and operating margins.\n\u2013Internal communications to management and the Board of Directors.\n\u2013Forecasted information within analyst, economist and industry reports of the Company and selected companies in its peer group.\n\u2022We considered the impact of industry and market conditions on management's forecasts.\n\u2022With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the discount rates, including testing the underlying source information and the mathematical\naccuracy of the calculations and developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rates selected by management.\n\u2022We evaluated the reasonableness of management's forecasts of future cash flows and discount rates utilized in the income approach fair value calculation by\ncomparing the income approach fair value to the market approach fair values.\nCommitments and Contingencies - Competition and Consumer Protection Reviews and Other Matters - Refer to Note 16 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company has been the subject of an open investigation with Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia in Spain (the \"CNMC\") as to whether\ncertain practices by Booking.com may produce adverse effects for hotels and other online travel companies. The Company recorded a loss contingency of 486\nmillion Euros ($530 million) in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n1.    BUSINESS DESCRIPTION\n \nBooking Holdings Inc. (\"Booking Holdings\" or the \"Company\") seeks to make it easier for everyone to experience the world by providing consumers,\ntravel service providers, and restaurants with leading travel and restaurant online reservation and related services. The Company offers its services through five\nprimary consumer-facing brands: Booking.com, Priceline, Agoda, KAYAK, and OpenTable, which allow consumers to: book a broad array of accommodations\n(including hotels, motels, resorts, homes, apartments, bed and breakfasts, hostels, and other alternative and traditional accommodations properties) and a flight to\ntheir destinations; make a car rental reservation or arrange for an airport taxi; make a dinner reservation; or book a vacation package, tour, activity, or cruise.\nConsumers can also use the Company's meta-search services to easily compare travel reservation information, such as flight, hotel, and rental car reservations\nfrom hundreds of online travel platforms at once. In addition, the Company offers other services to consumers, travel service providers and restaurants, such as\ntravel-related insurance products and restaurant management services. The Company's portfolio of brands are organized into four operating segments which are\naggregated into one reportable segment based on the similarity in economic characteristics, other qualitative factors, and the objectives and principles of\nAccounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 280, Segment Reporting.\n2.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation \nThe Company's Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including acquired\nbusinesses from the dates of acquisition. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\")\nrequires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and footnotes thereto. Actual results may\ndiffer significantly from those estimates. The estimates underlying the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements relate to, among other things, the valuation\nof goodwill and other long-lived tangible and intangible assets, the valuation of investments in private companies, income taxes, contingencies, stock-based\ncompensation, the allowance for expected credit losses (also referred to as provision for bad debts or provision for uncollectible accounts), chargeback\nprovisions, and the accrual of obligations for incentive programs.\nImpact of COVID-19\nThe Company's financial results and prospects are almost entirely dependent on facilitating the sale of travel-related services. The COVID-19 pandemic,\nsince its outset in 2020, and the resulting implementation of travel restrictions by governments around the world resulted in a significant decline in travel\nactivities and consumer demand for travel related services, in 2020 in particular. Even though there have been improvements in the economic and operating\nconditions for the Company's business since the outset of the pandemic, the Company cannot predict the long-term effects of the pandemic on its business or the\ntravel and restaurant industries as a whole.\nFair Value\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date.\nThere are three levels of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1:    Quoted prices in active markets that are accessible by the Company at the measurement date for identical assets and liabilities.\nLevel 2:    Inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly. Such prices may be based upon quoted prices for identical or comparable securities in\nactive markets or inputs not quoted on active markets, but corroborated by market data.\nLevel 3:    Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available.\n \n77", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4206, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a6fe8600-7c4e-41be-bb12-1e2e86dcc678": {"__data__": {"id_": "a6fe8600-7c4e-41be-bb12-1e2e86dcc678", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "80", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "576a0ebb-6412-4c9d-ba60-db04bd4f6de0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "80", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "e95ebedb978a2d2c05a90e4bbd8e19bdc79980dba4e7cd22de6cf79caf445068", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Cash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consists primarily of cash and highly liquid investment grade securities with an original maturity of three months or less.\nCash equivalents are recognized based on settlement date. See Note 20 for information related to restricted cash and cash equivalents.\nInvestments\nDebt Securities\nThe Company has classified its investments in debt securities as available-for-sale securities. Preferred stock that is either mandatorily redeemable or\nredeemable at the option of the investor is considered a debt security for accounting purposes and is reported at estimated fair value with the aggregate unrealized\ngains and losses, net of tax, reflected in \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of these investments is\nbased on the specific quoted market price of the securities or comparable securities at the balance sheet dates. Unobservable inputs are also used when little or no\nmarket data is available. See Note 6 for information related to fair value measurements.\nIf the amortized cost basis of an available-for-sale security exceeds its fair value and if the Company has the intention to sell the security or it is more\nlikely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis, an impairment is recognized in the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations. If the Company does not have the intention to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to\nsell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis and the Company determines that the decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis of an\navailable-for-sale security is entirely or partially due to credit-related factors, the credit loss is measured and recognized as an allowance for expected credit\nlosses along with the related expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The allowance is measured as the amount by which the debt security's\namortized cost basis exceeds the Company's best estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected.\nThe Company's investments in marketable debt securities are recognized based on the trade date. The cost of marketable debt securities sold is\ndetermined using a first-in and first-out method. The Company's investments in debt securities are assessed for classification in the Consolidated Balance Sheets\nas short-term or long-term at the individual security level. Classification as short-term or long-term is based on the maturities of the securities, as applicable, and\nthe Company's expectations regarding the timing of sales and redemptions. Investments of a strategic nature that have been made for the purpose of affiliation or\npotential business advantage or in connection with a commercial relationship are included in \"Long-term investments\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets,\nexcept in situations where the Company expects the investment to be realized in cash, redeemed, or sold within one year.\nEquity Securities\nEquity securities are reported as \"Long-term investments\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and include equity investments with readily determinable\nfair values and equity investments without readily determinable fair values. Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are reported at estimated\nfair value with changes in fair value recognized in \"Other income (expense), net\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company holds investments\nin equity securities of private companies, over which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence or control. These investments,\nwhich do not have readily determinable fair values, are measured at cost less impairment, if any. Such investments are also required to be measured at fair value\nas of the date of certain observable transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.\nAccounts Receivable from Customers and Allowance for Expected Credit Losses\nAccounts receivable is reported net of expected credit losses. The Company estimates lifetime expected credit losses upon recognition of the financial\nassets. The Company identifies the relevant risk characteristics of its customers and the related receivables and prepayments, which include the following: size,\ntype (alternative accommodations vs. hotels) or geographic location of the customer, or a combination of these characteristics. Receivables with similar risk\ncharacteristics have been grouped into pools. For each pool, the Company considers the historical credit loss experience, current economic conditions,\nsupportable forecasts of future economic conditions, and any recoveries in assessing the lifetime expected credit losses. Other key factors that influence the\nexpected credit loss analysis include customer demographics, payment terms offered in the normal course of business to customers, the nature of competition,\nand industry-specific factors that could impact the Company's receivables. Additionally, external data and macroeconomic conditions are considered. This is\nassessed at each balance sheet date based on the Company's specific facts and circumstances.\n78", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5233, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e69943e-9d3f-4ea4-96a4-d24ca8661e74": {"__data__": {"id_": "8e69943e-9d3f-4ea4-96a4-d24ca8661e74", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "81", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4869ebfc-a42b-43e0-86ee-8724722cdb40", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "81", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "25b1969f8fcafdf4bbfd660f35a7534cf081e36415e0dd27b59fa18f2fb69f7b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Property and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful\nlives of the assets or, when applicable, the lease term related to leasehold improvements, whichever is shorter.\nWebsite Costs and Internal-use Software\nAcquisition costs and certain direct development costs associated with website and internal-use software are capitalized and include external direct costs\nof services and payroll costs for employees devoting time to the software projects principally related to platform development, including support systems,\nsoftware coding, designing system interfaces, and installation and testing of the software. These costs are recorded as property and equipment and are generally\namortized beginning when the asset is substantially ready for use. Costs incurred for enhancements that are expected to result in additional features or\nfunctionalities are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the enhancements. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage, as well as\nmaintenance and training costs, are expensed as incurred.\nCloud Computing Arrangements\nThe Company utilizes various third-party computer systems and third-party service providers, including global distribution systems (\"GDSs\") and\ncomputerized central reservation systems of the accommodation, rental car, and airline industries in connection with providing some of its services. The\nCompany uses both internally-developed systems and third-party systems to operate its services, including transaction processing, order management, and\nfinancial and accounting systems. Implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract are capitalized and amortized over the term of\nthe hosting arrangement. The capitalized implementation costs are reported as \"Prepaid expenses, net\" or \"Other assets, net\" in the Company's Consolidated\nBalance Sheets, as appropriate. The related amortization expenses are reported in \"Information technology\" expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements\nof Operations.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, when a contract is signed. The Company determines if a lease is an operating\nor finance lease and records a lease asset and a lease liability upon lease commencement, which is the date when the underlying asset is made available for use by\nthe lessor. The Company has operating leases for office space, and data centers. For office space and data centers, the Company has elected to combine the fixed\npayments to lease the asset and any fixed non-lease payments (such as maintenance or utility charges) when determining its lease payments. The Company's\nfinance leases are mainly for computer equipment.\nThe Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as its discount rate to determine the present value of its remaining lease payments to calculate its\nlease assets and lease liabilities because the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. The incremental borrowing rate approximates the rate the\nCompany would pay to borrow in the currency of the lease payments on a collateralized basis for the weighted-average life of the lease. Operating lease assets\nalso include any prepaid lease payments and lease incentives received prior to lease commencement.\nThe Company recognizes operating lease costs and the amortization of finance lease assets on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The interest\ncomponent of a finance lease is recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term. Certain of the Company's lease agreements include rent\npayments which are adjusted periodically based on an index or rate. Any change in payments due to such adjustments are recognized as variable lease expense as\nthey are incurred. Variable lease expense also includes costs for property taxes, insurance, and services provided by the lessor which are charged based on usage\nor performance (such as maintenance or utility charges).\nMost leases have one or more options to renew beyond their initial term. The exercise of renewal options, mainly for office space and data centers, is at\nthe Company's discretion and are included in the determination of the lease term for accounting purposes if they are reasonably certain to be exercised.\nBusiness Combinations, Goodwill, and Intangible Assets\nThe Company accounts for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting. The consideration transferred is allocated to the assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective values at the acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred over the net of the amounts\nallocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The Company generally recognizes and measures contract assets\nand contract liabilities in a business combination at amounts consistent with those recorded by the acquired business.\n79", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5027, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a28e17a9-d352-4d87-aef6-4185340f392e": {"__data__": {"id_": "a28e17a9-d352-4d87-aef6-4185340f392e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "82", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bec69616-d057-4ff0-a8d2-194d7a1086db", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "82", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "a094520b16d4ba26df82a49e4e4925a29758bd6d7a1a723e0580ce6abdda0d95", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Goodwill is assigned to reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. Goodwill is not subject to\namortization and is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not\nreduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company tests goodwill at a reporting unit level. The fair value of the reporting unit is\ncompared to its carrying value, including goodwill. Fair values are determined using a combination of standard valuation techniques, including an income\napproach (discounted cash flows) and market approaches (e.g., earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (\"EBITDA\") multiples of\ncomparable publicly traded companies) and based on market participant assumptions. A goodwill impairment loss is measured at the amount by which a\nreporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. See Note 11 for additional information.\nIntangible assets are carried at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets, including intangible assets and operating lease assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate\nthat the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based upon the Company's ability to recover the carrying\nvalue of the assets from the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, before interest and taxes, of the related asset group. The amount of impairment loss, if\nany, is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over the present value of estimated future cash flows, using a discount rate commensurate with\nthe risks involved and based on assumptions representative of market participants.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe functional currency of the Company's subsidiaries is generally the respective local currency. For operations outside of the U.S., assets and liabilities\nare translated into U.S. Dollars at the rate of exchange existing at the balance sheet date. Income statement amounts are translated at monthly average exchange\nrates applicable for the period. Translation gains and losses are included as a component of \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss\" in the Company's\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in \"Other income (expense), net\" in the Company's Consolidated\nStatements of Operations.\nDerivatives\nDerivatives not Designated as Hedges\nAs a result of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., it is exposed to various market risks that may affect its consolidated results of operations,\ncash flows, and financial position. These market risks include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For the Company's\noperations outside of the U.S., the primary foreign currency exposures are in Euros and British Pounds Sterling, the currencies in which the Company conducts a\nsignificant portion of its business activities. As a result, the Company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates as the financial\nresults of its operations outside of the U.S. are translated from local currencies into U.S. Dollars upon consolidation. Additionally, foreign currency exchange rate\nfluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of an entity result in gains and losses that are reflected in net income.\n \nThe Company may enter into derivative instruments to hedge certain net exposures of nonfunctional currency denominated assets and liabilities and the\nvolatility associated with translating earnings for its operations outside of the U.S. into U.S. Dollars, even though it does not elect to apply hedge accounting or\nhedge accounting does not apply. These contracts are generally short-term in duration. Certain of the Company's derivative instruments have master netting\narrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. The Company is exposed to the risk that\ncounterparties to derivative instruments may fail to meet their contractual obligations. The Company regularly reviews its credit exposure and assesses the\ncreditworthiness of its counterparties. The Company reports the fair value of its derivative assets and liabilities on a gross basis in the Consolidated Balance\nSheets in \"Other current assets\" and \"Accrued expenses and other current liabilities,\" respectively. Unless designated as hedges for accounting purposes, gains\nand losses resulting from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recognized in \"Other income (expense), net\" in the Consolidated Statements of\nOperations in the period that the changes occur and are classified within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" or \"Net cash used in financing activities,\" as\nappropriate, in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

See Notes 12 and 14 for\nadditional information related to the net investment hedge.\nRevenue Recognition\nOnline travel reservation services\nSubstantially all of the Company's revenues are generated by providing online travel reservation services, which principally allows travelers to book\ntravel reservations with travel service providers through the Company's platforms. While the Company generally refers to a consumer that books travel\nreservation services on the Company's platforms as its customer, for accounting purposes, the Company's customers are the travel service providers and, in\ncertain merchant transactions, the travelers. The Company's contracts with travel service providers give them the ability to market their reservation availability\nwithout transferring to the Company the responsibility to deliver the travel services. Therefore, the Company's revenues are presented on a net basis in the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations. These contracts include payment terms and establish the consideration to which the Company is entitled, which includes\neither a commission or a margin on the travel transaction. Revenue is measured based on the expected consideration specified in the contract with the travel\nservice provider, considering the effects of factors such as discounts and other sales incentives. Estimates for sales incentives are based on historical experience,\ncurrent trends, and forecasts, as applicable. Coupons are recorded as a reduction of the transaction price, generally at the time they are redeemed. The local\noccupancy taxes, general excise taxes, value-added taxes, sales taxes, and other similar taxes (\"travel transaction taxes\"), if any, collected from travelers are\nreported on a net basis in revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nRevenues for online travel reservation services are recognized at a point in time when the Company has completed its post-booking services and the\ntravelers begin using the arranged travel services. These revenues are classified into two categories:\n\u2022Merchant revenues are derived from travel-related transactions where the Company facilitates payments from travelers for the services provided,\ngenerally at the time of booking. Merchant revenues are derived from transactions where travelers book accommodation, rental car, airline\nreservations, and other travel related services. Merchant revenues include travel reservation commissions and transaction net revenues (i.e., the\namount charged to travelers less the amount owed to travel service providers) in connection with the Company's merchant reservations services;\ncredit card processing rebates and customer processing fees; and ancillary fees, including travel-related insurance revenues.\n\u2022Agency revenues are derived from the Company's commissions on travel-related transactions where the Company does not facilitate payments from\ntravelers for the services provided.\nAdvertising and Other Revenues\nAdvertising and other revenues are primarily recognized by KAYAK and OpenTable. KAYAK recognizes advertising revenue primarily by sending\nreferrals to online travel companies (\"OTCs\") and travel service providers and from advertising placements on its platforms. Revenue related to referrals is\nrecognized when a consumer clicks on a referral placement or upon completion of the travel. Revenue for advertising placements is recognized based upon when\na consumer clicks on an advertisement or when KAYAK displays an advertisement. OpenTable recognizes revenues for reservation fees when diners are seated\nthrough its online restaurant reservation service and subscription fees for restaurant management services on a straight-line basis over the contractual period in\naccordance with how the service is provided.\n81", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4423, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3f7932f-ae46-496d-8889-f2a8ac36ccde": {"__data__": {"id_": "b3f7932f-ae46-496d-8889-f2a8ac36ccde", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a101ab75-67ae-4652-a010-9ec224b4bf36", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "2bc02b02f9ecf12184f877967f28f48542ce4c05e990fab4efbfecabb8123a9a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Incentive Programs\nThe Company provides various incentive programs such as referral bonuses, rebates, credits, and discounts. In addition, the Company offers loyalty\nprograms where participating consumers may be awarded loyalty points on current transactions that can be redeemed in the future. The estimated value of the\nincentives granted and the loyalty points expected to be redeemed is generally recognized as a reduction of revenue at the time they are granted.\nDeferred Merchant Bookings\nCash payments received from travelers in advance of the Company completing its performance obligations are included in \"Deferred merchant\nbookings\" in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and are comprised principally of amounts estimated to be payable to travel service providers as well as\nthe Company's estimated future revenue for its commission or margin and fees. The amounts are mostly subject to refunds for cancellations. The Company\nexpects to complete its performance obligations generally within one year from the reservation date. The increase in the Deferred Merchant Booking balance\nduring the year ended December 31, 2023 was principally due to the increase in business volumes.\nMarketing Expenses\nThe Company's advertising expenses are reported in \"Marketing expenses\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Marketing expenses consist of\nperformance marketing expenses and brand marketing expenses. These expenses consist primarily of the costs of: (1) search engine keyword purchases; (2)\naffiliate programs; (3) referrals from meta-search websites; and (4) online and offline brand marketing. Performance marketing expenses are expenses generally\nmeasured by return on investment or an increase in bookings over a specified time period and are recognized as incurred. Brand marketing expenses are expenses\nincurred to build brand awareness over a specified time period. These expenses consist primarily of television advertising and online video and display\nadvertising (including the airing of the Company's television advertising online), as well as other marketing expenses such as public relations and sponsorships.\nBrand marketing expenses are generally recognized as incurred with the exception of advertising production costs, which are deferred and expensed the first time\nthe advertisement is displayed or broadcast.\nSales and Other Expenses\nSales and other expenses are generally variable in nature and consist primarily of: (1) credit card and other payment processing fees associated with\nmerchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third parties that provide call center and other customer services; (3) digital services taxes and other similar taxes (4)\nchargeback provisions and fraud prevention expenses associated with merchant transactions; (5) provisions for expected credit losses, primarily related to\naccommodation commission receivables and prepayments to certain customers; and (6) customer relations costs.\nPersonnel Expenses\nPersonnel expenses consist of compensation to the Company's personnel, including salaries, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, payroll taxes, and\nemployee health and other benefits.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense related to performance share units, restricted stock units and stock options is recognized based on fair value on a\nstraight-line basis over the respective requisite service periods and forfeitures are accounted for when they occur. The fair value on the grant date of performance\nshare units and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of units granted and the quoted price of the Company's common stock. For performance\nshare units with market conditions, the effect of the market condition is also considered in the determination of fair value on the grant date using Monte Carlo\nsimulations. The fair value of employee stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes model.\nThe Company records stock-based compensation expense for performance-based awards using its estimate of the probable outcome at the end of the\nperformance period (i.e., the estimated performance against the performance targets or performance goals, as applicable). The Company periodically adjusts the\ncumulative stock-based compensation expense recorded when the probable outcome for these performance-based awards is updated based upon changes in actual\nand forecasted operating results or expected achievement of performance goals, as applicable.\n \nThe benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a discrete\nitem when an option exercise or a vesting and release of shares occurs. Excess tax benefits are presented as operating cash flows and cash payments for employee\nstatutory tax withholding related to vested stock awards are presented as financing cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. \n82", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4920, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e8bba8d3-e619-44e1-84f8-cf6429c840c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "e8bba8d3-e619-44e1-84f8-cf6429c840c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "85", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "be7b82c5-18fc-41c7-a359-fbef60414441", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "85", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "060f9657f9f050e8bf593cbd4961a0d056cc35b2098cbd03c88c0aa7326746b8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "General and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of fees for certain outside professionals, occupancy and office expenses, certain travel transaction\ntaxes, and personnel-related expenses such as travel, relocation, recruiting, and training expenses.\nInformation Technology Expenses\nInformation technology expenses consist primarily of: (1) software license and system maintenance fees; (2) cloud computing costs and outsourced data\ncenter costs; (3) payments to contractors; and (4) data communications and other expenses associated with operating the Company's services.\nIncome Taxes \nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. The Company records the estimated future tax effects of temporary\ndifferences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit\ncarryforwards. Deferred taxes are classified as non-current in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n \nThe Company records deferred tax assets to the extent it believes these assets will more likely than not be realized. The Company regularly reviews its\ndeferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing\ntemporary differences, the carryforward periods available for tax reporting purposes, and tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is provided when it is\nmore likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation\nof future taxable income during the period in which related temporary differences become deductible. In determining the future tax consequences of events that\nhave been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns, significant judgments, estimates, and interpretation of statutes are required.\nDeferred taxes are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are\nexpected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date of\nsuch change.\n \nThe Company recognizes liabilities when it believes that uncertain positions may not be fully sustained upon audit by the tax authorities. Liabilities\nrecognized for uncertain tax positions are based on a two-step approach for recognition and measurement. First, the Company evaluates the tax position for\nrecognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit based on its\ntechnical merits. Second, the Company measures the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate\nsettlement. Interest and penalties attributable to uncertain tax positions, if any, are recognized as a component of income tax expense. \nThe Company accounts for taxes on global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\") introduced by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") as\nperiod costs. See Note 15 for further details related to income taxes.\nGovernment Grants and Other Assistance\nThe Company recognizes government grants in the financial statements when it is probable that the grant will be received and the Company will comply\nwith the conditions of the grant. Government grants are recorded as a reduction in the related operating expense or the cost of the asset that they are intended to\ndefray. The government grants received by the Company during the COVID-19 pandemic have principally been granted to defray personnel costs and were\nsubsequently returned to the respective governments. See Note 20 for information related to government grants and other assistance.\nContingencies\nLoss contingencies (other than income tax-related contingencies) arise from actual or possible claims and assessments and pending or threatened\nlitigation that may be brought against the Company by individuals, governments or other entities. Based on the Company's assessment of loss contingencies at\neach balance sheet date, a loss is recorded in the financial statements if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the\namount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.\n83", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4414, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "440b7fab-3be8-4ff0-a1b2-279d268b4d27": {"__data__": {"id_": "440b7fab-3be8-4ff0-a1b2-279d268b4d27", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "86", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b5927fe4-5d58-4716-9655-f311b193501b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "86", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "6fe3d468da8d7423303f31de3905d946dc1581aef082c4acb0d0459743674921", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Reclassification\nIn the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company has reclassified certain indirect taxes,\nprimarily digital services taxes, between \"General and administrative\" expenses and \"Sales and other expenses\" to conform to the presentation in the\nConsolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2023. The current presentation of \"Sales and other expenses\" reflects the aggregation of\ncosts that are generally more likely to vary based on changes in revenues. These reclassifications did not affect previously reported Revenue, Operating income,\nIncome before income taxes, or Net income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. See Note 21 for\nadditional information on the impact of the reclassification by quarter.\nThe following table presents the impact of the reclassifications on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2021\nSales and other expenses (Prior presentation) $ 1,818 $ 881 \nReclassifications 168 98 \nSales and other expenses (New presentation) $ 1,986 $ 979 \nGeneral and administrative (Prior presentation) $ 934 $ 620 \nReclassifications (168) (98)\nGeneral and administrative (New presentation) $ 766 $ 522 \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted\n    \nAccounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity\nOn January 1, 2022, the Company adopted the new accounting standards update relating to convertible instruments and contracts in an entity's own\nequity. Compared to legacy U.S. GAAP, the accounting standards update reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments, requires\nfewer embedded conversion features to be separately recognized from the host contract, and amends certain guidance to reduce form-over-substance-based\naccounting conclusions. Under the updated guidance, upon the initial recognition of convertible debt, the Company presents the entire amount attributable to the\ndebt as a liability. The initial carrying amount of the convertible debt liability is reduced by any direct and incremental issuance costs paid to third parties that are\nassociated with the convertible debt issuance. No amount attributable to the debt is initially recognized within equity unless the instrument is issued at a\nsubstantial premium. In calculating diluted earnings per share, the accounting standards update also requires the use of the if-converted method for the\nCompany's convertible debt.\nThe Company adopted the accounting standards update on a modified retrospective basis applied to the 0.75% convertible senior notes due May 2025\n(see Note 12) resulting in an increase of $30 million to \"Retained earnings\" as of January 1, 2022. The significant corresponding balance sheet changes as of that\ndate were an increase of $86 million to \"Long-term debt\" and decreases of $96 million to \"Additional paid-in capital\" and $21 million to \"Deferred income\ntaxes.\" For the Company's convertible debt, interest expense for the periods beginning on January 1, 2022 is reflected in the financial statements using interest\nrates that are closer to the coupon interest rate of the debt rather than the higher imputed interest expense that resulted from the separation of conversion features\nrequired by legacy U.S. GAAP. See Note 8 for additional information on net income per share calculations.\nOther Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nImprovements to Income Tax Disclosures\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued an accounting standards update related to income taxes that requires\ncompanies to provide additional information on the rate reconciliation and additional disclosures about taxes paid. The update requires disclosure of additional\ncategories of information in the tax rate reconciliation table about federal, state and foreign income taxes and more details about certain items that meet a\nquantitative threshold. Income taxes paid (net of refunds received) are required to be disclosed disaggregated by federal (national), state and foreign taxes and\nalso by jurisdiction based on a quantitative threshold. The update is effective for annual financial statements beginning with the fiscal year 2025.

REVENUE\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nRevenue by Type of Service\nApproximately 89%, 89%, and 87% of the Company's revenues for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, relate to online\naccommodation reservation services. Revenues from all other sources of online travel reservation services and advertising and other revenues each individually\nrepresent less than 10% of the Company's total revenues for each year. The majority of the Company's merchant revenues and substantially all of its agency\nrevenues are from Booking.com's accommodation reservations.\nRevenue by Geographic Area\nSee Note 17 for the information related to revenue by geographic area.\nIncentive Programs\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, liabilities of $149 million and $143 million, respectively, were included in \"Accrued expenses and other current\nliabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for incentives granted to consumers, including referral bonuses, rebates, credits, discounts, and loyalty programs.\n4.    STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Company's 1999 Omnibus Plan, as amended and restated effective June 3, 2021, (the \"1999 Plan\") is the primary stock compensation plan from\nwhich broad-based employee, non-employee director, and consultant equity awards may be made. At December 31, 2023, there were approximately one million\nshares of common stock available for future grants under the 1999 Plan.\n \nStock-based compensation issued under the plans generally consists of restricted stock units, performance share units, and stock options. Performance\nshare units and restricted stock units are payable in shares of the Company's common stock upon vesting. The Company issues shares of its common stock upon\nthe exercise of stock options. The tax benefit related to stock-based compensation was $52 million, $40 million, and $37 million for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nIn 2021, the Company modified the performance-based awards granted in 2018 and 2019 to its executive officers to adjust the number of shares to be\nissued, subject to other vesting conditions. The modification, in aggregate, resulted in additional stock-based compensation expense of $40 million, which was\nrecognized over the remaining requisite service periods for the performance-based awards.\n85", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3194, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68b5f5eb-4764-4b34-8f3b-83341f46fc6e": {"__data__": {"id_": "68b5f5eb-4764-4b34-8f3b-83341f46fc6e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "88", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "427d132c-690a-4111-8dfb-2f8e4690b692", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "88", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "800357f795badd45f1b761537901c01ef9fd0b17e8277ddfcdc25bcccd916db0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Restricted Stock Units and Performance Share Units\nThe Company makes broad-based grants of restricted stock units that generally vest during a period of one- to three-years, subject to certain exceptions\nfor terminations other than for \"cause,\" for \"good reason,\" or on account of death or disability.

A market approach is used for\nrecurring fair value measurements and the valuation techniques use inputs that are observable, or can be corroborated by observable data, in an active\nmarketplace.\nInvestments in private companies measured using Level 3 inputs\nThe Company's investments measured using Level 3 inputs primarily consist of investments in privately-held companies. Fair values of privately-held\nsecurities are estimated using a variety of valuation methodologies, including both market and income approaches. The Company uses valuation techniques\nappropriate for the type of investment and the information available about the investee as of the valuation date to determine fair value. Recent financing\ntransactions in the investee are generally considered the best indication of the enterprise value and therefore used as a basis to estimate fair value. However,\nbased on a number of factors, such as the proximity in timing to the valuation date or the volume or other terms of these financing transactions, the Company\nmay also use other valuation techniques to supplement this data, including the income approach. When a financing transaction occurs and represents fair value,\nthe Company also uses the calibration process, as appropriate, when estimating fair value on subsequent measurement dates. Calibration is the process of using\nobserved transactions in the investee company's own instruments to ensure that the valuation techniques that will be employed to value the investee company\ninvestment on subsequent measurement dates begin with assumptions that are consistent with the original observed transaction as well as any more recent\nobserved transactions in the instruments issued by the investee company.(1)\n90", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3371, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dc8792dc-c979-411d-97ce-d1bbaf3aab7e": {"__data__": {"id_": "dc8792dc-c979-411d-97ce-d1bbaf3aab7e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "93", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5e7a052a-be4e-4f67-b14f-41af7bb5a55b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "93", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "c3f340089b90e9e514f02d6feb90e8ed3dbc4c0b2401a4cad120d0a3f01d13af", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company evaluated its investment in Yanolja for impairment using a combination of the market approach and the\nincome approach in estimating the fair value of the investment as of those dates, and recognized impairment charges. The market approach estimates value using\nprices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving comparable companies. The income approach estimates value based on the\nexpectation of future cash flows that a company will generate. These future cash flows are discounted to their present values using a discount rate based on a\ncompany's weighted-average cost of capital adjusted to reflect the risks inherent in its cash flows. The key unobservable inputs and ranges used for the June 2023\nimpairment evaluation, primarily using the income approach, include the weighted average cost of capital (10.5%-14.5%) and the terminal EBITDA multiple\n(14x-16x). The key unobservable inputs and ranges used for the June 2022 impairment evaluation include, for the market approach, percentage decrease in the\ncalibrated EBITDA multiple (36%) and for the income approach, the weighted average cost of capital (10%-14%) and the terminal EBITDA multiple (14x-16x).\nSignificant changes in any of these inputs in isolation would result in significantly different fair value measurements. A change in the assumption used for\nEBITDA multiples would result in a directionally similar change in the fair value, and a change in the assumption used for weighted average cost of capital\nwould result in a directionally opposite change in the fair value.\nThe determination of the fair values of investments, where the Company is a minority shareholder and has access to limited information from the\ninvestee, reflects numerous assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including key assumptions regarding the investee's expected growth\nrates and operating margin, as well as other key assumptions with respect to matters outside of the Company's control, such as discount rates and market\ncomparables. It requires significant judgments and estimates and actual results could be materially different than those judgments and estimates utilized in the\nfair value estimate. Future events and changing market conditions may lead the Company to re-evaluate the assumptions reflected in the valuation which may\nresult in a need to recognize additional impairment charges.\nDerivatives\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. The Company mitigates these risks by\nfollowing established risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivatives. The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to\nhedge its exposure to the impact of movements in foreign currency exchange rates on its transactional balances denominated in currencies other than the\nfunctional currency. The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.\nThe Company's derivative instruments are valued using pricing models. Pricing models take into account the contract terms as well as multiple inputs\nwhere applicable, such as interest rate yield curves, option volatility, and foreign currency exchange rates. The valuation of derivatives is considered \"Level 2\"\nfair value measurement. The Company's derivative instruments are typically short-term in nature. The Company reports the fair values of its derivative assets and\nliabilities on a gross basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in \"Other current assets\" and \"Accrued expenses and other current liabilities,\" respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not designate any derivatives as hedges for accounting purposes. Gains and losses resulting from\nchanges in the fair values of derivative instruments are recognized in \"Other income (expense), net\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period\nthat the changes occur and cash flow impacts, if any, are classified within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" or \"Net cash used in financing activities,\"\nas appropriate, in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nThe table below provides estimated fair values and notional amounts of foreign currency exchange derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2023 and\n2022 (in millions).

The remaining balance principally\nrelates to receivables from marketing affiliates. The Company's receivables are short-term in nature. In addition, the Company had prepayments to certain\ncustomers of $10 million and $29 million, included in \"Prepaid expenses, net,\" and $16 million and $5 million, included in \"Other assets, net\" in the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

If the conversion prices for the\nconvertible senior notes exceed the Company's average stock price for the period, the convertible senior notes generally have no impact on diluted net income per\nshare. For periods prior to January 1, 2022, the treasury stock method was used for convertible senior notes in the calculation of diluted net income per share.\nFollowing the adoption of the accounting standards update on January 1, 2022 (see Note 2), the if-converted method is used for all periods after that date.\nA reconciliation of the weighted-average number of shares outstanding used in calculating diluted net income per share is as follows (in thousands): \n Year Ended December 31,\n 2023 2022 2021\nWeighted-average number of basic common shares outstanding 36,140 39,872 41,042 \nWeighted-average dilutive stock options, restricted stock units and performance share units 228 151 209 \nAssumed conversion of convertible senior notes 162 29 111 \nWeighted-average number of diluted common and common equivalent shares outstanding 36,530 40,052 41,362 \n93", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2954, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "583a5a8a-4db5-4bf9-8f6d-30f695609154": {"__data__": {"id_": "583a5a8a-4db5-4bf9-8f6d-30f695609154", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc8d61f0-0c13-4ae3-add3-8adca84a4484", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "3a106697a1f8a09931f2d8fe7b66b969288cbf0f89d11f2be16a659369342c01", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "9.

The fair values were estimated based upon actual trades at the end of the reporting period or the\nmost recent trade available as well as the Company's stock price at the end of the reporting period. The estimated fair value of the Company's debt in excess of\nthe outstanding principal amount at December 31, 2023 primarily relates to the conversion premium on the convertible senior notes due in May 2025. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, the outstanding principal amount of the Company's debt exceeds the fair value of debt mainly due to the increase in interest rates partially\noffset by the conversion premium on the convertible senior notes due in May 2025.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nIn April 2020, the Company issued $863 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due in May 2025 with an interest rate of 0.75%\n(the \"May 2025 Notes\"). The Company paid $19 million in debt issuance costs during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the issuance. The May 2025\nNotes are convertible, subject to certain conditions, into the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $1,886.44 per share. The May 2025 Notes are\nconvertible, at the option of the holder, prior to November 1, 2024, upon the occurrence of specific events, including but not limited to a change in control, or if\nthe closing sales price of the Company's common stock for at least 20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of\nthe immediately preceding calendar quarter is more than 130% of the conversion price in effect for the notes on the last trading day of the immediately preceding\nquarter. In the event that all or substantially all of the Company's common stock is acquired on or prior to the maturity of the May 2025 Notes in a transaction in\nwhich the consideration paid to holders of the Company's common stock consists of all or substantially all cash, the Company would be required to make\nadditional payments in the form of additional shares of common stock to the holders of the May 2025 Notes in an aggregate value ranging from $0 to\n$235 million depending upon the date of the transaction and the then current stock price of the Company. Starting on November 1, 2024, holders will have the\nright to convert all or any portion of the May 2025 Notes, regardless of the Company's stock price. The May 2025 Notes may not be redeemed by the Company\nprior to maturity. The holders may require the Company to repurchase the May 2025 Notes for cash in certain circumstances. Interest on the May 2025 Notes is\npayable on May 1 and November 1 of each year. If the note holders exercise their option to convert, the Company delivers cash to repay the principal amount of\nthe notes and delivers shares of common stock or cash, at its option, to satisfy the conversion value in excess of the principal amount. Based on the closing sales\nprices of the Company's common stock for the prescribed measurement periods, the May 2025 Notes were convertible at the option of the holder starting the\nsecond calendar quarter of 2023 and continue to be convertible during the first calendar quarter of 2024.

The value assigned to the debt component was the estimated fair value, at the issuance date, of a similar\nbond without the conversion feature. The difference between the bond cash proceeds and this estimated fair value, representing the value assigned to the equity\ncomponent, was recorded as a debt discount. Debt discount was amortized using the effective interest rate method over the period from the origination date\nthrough the stated maturity date. The Company estimated the borrowing rates at debt origination to be 4.10% for the May 2025 Notes, considering its credit\nrating and similar debt of the Company or comparable corporate issuers without the conversion feature. The yield to maturity was estimated at an at-market\ncoupon priced at par.

TREASURY STOCK AND DIVIDENDS\n \nAt December 31, 2022, the Company had a total remaining authorization of $3.9 billion related to a program authorized by the Company's Board of\nDirectors (\"the Board\") in 2019 to repurchase up to $15 billion of the Company's common stock. In the first quarter of 2023, the Board authorized an additional\nprogram to repurchase up to $20 billion of the Company's common stock. At December 31, 2023, the Company had a total remaining authorization of $13.7\nbillion to repurchase its common stock. The Company expects to complete the share repurchases under the remaining authorization by the end of 2026, assuming\nno major downturn in the travel market. Additionally, the Board has given the Company the general authorization to repurchase shares of its common stock\nwithheld to satisfy employee withholding tax obligations related to stock-based compensation.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's stock repurchase activities during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 (in millions,\nexcept for shares, which are reflected in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nShares Amount Shares Amount Shar es Amount\nAuthorized stock repurchase programs 3,660 $ 10,249 3,320 $ 6,526 \u2014 $ \u2014 \nGeneral authorization for shares withheld on stock\naward vesting 72 194 80 167 71 162 \nTotal 3,732$ 10,443 3,400$ 6,693 71 $ 162 \nStock repurchases of $40 million in December 2023 were settled in January 2024. Stock repurchases of $70 million in December 2022 were settled in\nJanuary 2023. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the Company remitted employee withholding taxes of $194 million, $165 million, and\n$163 million, respectively, to the tax authorities, which is different from the aggregate cost of the shares withheld for taxes for each year due to the timing in\nremitting the taxes. The cash remitted to the tax authorities is included in financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nEffective January 1, 2023, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 has mandated a 1% excise tax on share repurchases. Excise tax obligations that result\nfrom the Company's share repurchases are accounted for as a cost of the treasury stock transaction. As of December 31, 2023, the Company recorded an\nestimated excise tax liability of $96 million for stock repurchases during the year ended December 31, 2023, which is included in \"Accrued expenses and other\ncurrent liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nOn January 25, 2024, the Board adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which the Company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends on its common stock.\nDeclaration of dividends pursuant to the policy will be subject to the Board\u2019s consideration of, among other things, the Company's financial performance, cash\nflows, capital needs, and liquidity. Pursuant to the dividend policy, on February 16, 2024 the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $8.75 per share of\ncommon stock, payable on March 28, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 8, 2024.\n100", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3262, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5774c554-7fe5-4eed-aa58-62ec39105058": {"__data__": {"id_": "5774c554-7fe5-4eed-aa58-62ec39105058", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "103", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "47a9f48d-64c3-41e6-a64f-c26d174ccc0f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "103", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "2c6432014fb7295e04ed9e3311e624fa5bcc56ae932aa55654a8e5b1586fcd4d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "14.

The Tax Act made significant changes to U.S. federal tax law, including a\none-time deemed repatriation tax on accumulated unremitted international earnings, to be paid over eight years. In 2023, the Company adjusted its income tax\nexpense that was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 relating to the federal one-time deemed repatriation liability. This expense resulted from the\nclosing of the 2017 and 2018 U.S federal income tax audits. Under the Tax Act, the Company's future cash generated by the Company's international operations\ncan generally be repatriated without further U.S. federal income tax, but will be subject to U.S. state income taxes and international withholding taxes, which\nhave been accrued by the Company. The Tax Act also introduced in 2018 a tax on 50% of GILTI, which is income determined to be in excess of a specified\nroutine rate of return, and a base erosion and anti-abuse tax (\"BEAT\") aimed at preventing the erosion of the U.S. tax base. The Company has adopted an\naccounting policy to treat taxes on GILTI as period costs.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nThe Company utilized $309 million of its U.S. NOLs to reduce its U.S. federal tax liability for the deemed repatriation tax.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nCompetition and Consumer Protection Reviews\nOnline travel platforms have been the subject of investigations or inquiries by national competition authorities (\"NCAs\") or other governmental\nauthorities regarding competition law matters, consumer protection issues, or other areas of concern. The Company is and has been involved in many such\ninvestigations. For example, the Company is involved in investigations related to whether Booking.com's contractual parity arrangements with accommodation\nproviders are anti-competitive because they require partners to provide Booking.com with rates, conditions, and availability at least as favorable as those offered\nto other OTCs or by the partner itself. To resolve certain of the parity-related investigations, the Company has from time to time made commitments regarding\nfuture business practices or activities, such as agreeing to narrow the scope of its parity clauses. These investigations have resulted in fines and the Company\ncould incur additional fines and/or be restricted in certain of its business practices in the future.\nIn October 2022, the Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia in Spain (the \"CNMC\") opened an investigation into whether certain\npractices by Booking.com may produce adverse effects for hotels and other OTCs. In January 2024, the CNMC notified Booking.com of its draft decision to\nimpose a fine of 486 million Euros and to restrict certain business practices such as those relating to parity provisions and criteria that Booking.com can use to\ndetermine how to rank hotels in its display to customers. The amount of the draft fine is based on Booking.com\u2019s historical revenues and it is possible the final\namount may be increased when the decision is finalized, which is expected by July 2024. Booking.com does not agree with the rationale stated in the draft\ndecision and certain of the restrictions sought to be imposed, and is continuing to engage with the CNMC prior to the decision being finalized. If the draft\ndecision were to become final, Booking.com plans to challenge aspects of the fine, decision, and/or restrictions. Although the Company disagrees with the\nrationale stated in the draft decision, the Company accrued a loss of 486 million Euros ($530 million) related to it, which is included in \"General and\nadministrative\" expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2023. The related liability is included in \"Accrued\nexpenses and other current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2023. In addition, in September 2017, the Swiss Price Surveillance\nOffice opened an investigation into the level of commissions of Booking.com in Switzerland and the investigation is ongoing. If there is an adverse outcome and\nBooking.com is unsuccessful in any appeal, Booking.com may be required to make other commitments, such as reducing its commissions in Switzerland. In July\n2023, the Polish Office of Competition and Consumer Protection opened an investigation into Booking.com's identification of private and professional hosts and\nits messaging in relation to obligations owed to consumers. If any of the investigations were to find that Booking.com practices violated the respective laws,\nBooking.com may face significant fines, restrictions on its business practices, and/or be required to make other commitments.\nThe Company is and has been involved in investigations or inquiries by NCAs or other governmental authorities involving consumer protection matters,\nincluding in the United Kingdom and the European Union. The Company has previously made certain voluntary commitments to competition authorities to\nresolve investigations or inquiries that have included showing prices inclusive of all mandatory taxes and charges, providing information about the effect of\nmoney earned on search result rankings on or before the search results page and making certain adjustments to how discounts and statements concerning\npopularity or availability are shown to consumers. In the future, it is possible new jurisdictions could engage the Company in discussions to implement changes\nto its business in those countries. The Company is unable to predict what, if any, effect any future similar commitments will have on its business, industry\npractices or online commerce more generally. To the extent that any other investigations or inquiries result in additional commitments, fines, damages or other\nremedies, the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.\nThe Company is unable to predict how any current or future investigations or litigation may be resolved or the long-term impact of any such resolution\non its business. For example, competition and consumer-law-related investigations, legislation, or issues could result in private litigation and the Company is\ncurrently involved in such litigation.

This unrecognized tax benefit is partially offset by a deferred income tax benefit of 15 million Euros ($17 million). As of December 31,\n2023, the Company made prepayments of 74 million Euros ($82 million) to the Italian tax authorities to forestall collection enforcement pending the appeal\nphase of the case.

The payments are included in \"Other assets, net\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2023 and December 31,\n2022.\nIn June 2021, the investigative arm of the Italian tax authorities issued a Tax Audit Report recommending that a formal tax assessment of 154 million\nEuros ($170 million), plus interest and penalties, be made on Booking.com BV for value-added taxes (\"VAT\") related to commissions charged to certain Italian\naccommodation providers from 2013 to 2019. In connection with the Tax Audit Report, the Genoa Public Prosecutor requested certain Booking.com tax\ninformation and related data. The Company is cooperating with regard to that request. While the Company continues to believe that Booking.com has been\ncompliant with applicable VAT laws, in July 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with the Italian tax authorities and paid approximately 93 million\nEuros ($103 million) to settle the issues raised in the Tax Audit Report for the periods 2013 through 2022.\nIn December 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with the French tax authorities to settle all the income and\nVAT assessments for the years 2006 through 2018 that were issued to Booking.com for a total amount of approximately\n153 million Euros ($163 million). The settlement amount was reflected in unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022.\nThe Company is also involved in other tax-related audits, investigations, and litigation relating to income taxes, value-added taxes, travel transaction\ntaxes (e.g., hotel occupancy taxes), withholding taxes, and other taxes. Any taxes or assessments in excess of the Company's tax provisions, including the\nresolution of any tax proceedings or litigation, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nIn some cases, assessments may be significantly in excess of the Company's tax provisions, particularly in instances where the Company does not agree with the\ntax authority's assessment of how the tax laws may apply to the Company's business.\nOther Matters\nBeginning in 2014, Booking.com B.V. received several letters from the Netherlands Pension Fund for the Travel Industry (Reiswerk) (\"BPF\") claiming\nthat it was required to participate in the mandatory pension scheme of the BPF with retroactive effect to 1999, which has a higher contribution rate than the\npension scheme in which it is currently participating. BPF instituted legal proceedings and in 2016 the District Court of Amsterdam rejected all of BPF's claims.\nBPF appealed the decision to the Court of Appeal, and, in May 2019, the Court of Appeal also rejected all of BPF's claims, in each case by ruling that Booking\ndid not meet the definition of a travel intermediary for purposes of the mandatory pension scheme. BPF then appealed to the Netherlands Supreme Court. In\nApril 2021, the Supreme Court overturned the previous decision of the Court of Appeal and held that Booking.com B.V. met the definition of a travel\nintermediary for the purposes of the mandatory pension scheme. The Supreme Court ruled only on the qualification of Booking as a travel intermediary for the\npurposes of the mandatory pension scheme and did not rule on the various other defenses brought forward by the Company against BPF's claims. The Supreme\nCourt referred the matter to another Court of Appeal to assess the other defenses brought forward by the Company.

The notes are represented by one or more registered notes in global form, but in certain limited circumstances may be represented by\nnotes in definitive form.\nThe maturity date of the notes is November 12, 2028.\nThe indenture does not limit the amount of debt that may be issued by us or our subsidiaries under the indenture or otherwise. Our subsidiaries do\nnot guarantee any of our obligations under the notes.

The term \u201cbusiness day\u201d means any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, (1) that is not a day on which banking institutions in the City of\nNew York or London are authorized or required by law or executive order to close and (2) on which the Trans-European Automated Real-time\nGross Settlement Express Transfer system (the TARGET2 system), or any successor thereto, is open.\nAll references to interest in this exhibit include additional interest, if any, payable as described under \u201cEvents of Default\u201d and at our election as the\nsole remedy relating to the failure to comply with our reporting obligations as described under \u201cEvents of Default\u201d.\nOptional Redemption\nOn and after October 12, 2028, the date that is one month prior to the scheduled maturity date (the \u201cPar Call Date\u201d), we may redeem the notes in\nwhole or in part, at our option at any time or from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be\nredeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption.\nPrior to the Par Call Date, we may redeem the notes in whole or in part (equal to \u20ac100,000 and integral multiples of \u20ac1,000 in excess thereof), at\nour option at any time or from time to time (a \u201cRedemption Date\u201d), at a redemption price equal to the greater of:\n(1) 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed; and\n(2) an amount equal to the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon that\nwould have been payable in respect of such notes calculated as if the maturity date of such notes was the Par Call Date, not\nincluding any portion of the payments of interest accrued to the Redemption Date, discounted to such Redemption Date on an\nannual basis at the Comparable Government Bond Rate, plus 25 basis points plus, in the case of each of (1) and (2), accrued\nand unpaid interest on the notes, if any, to, but excluding, such Redemption Date.\nIf less than all of the notes are to be redeemed, in the case of certificated notes and global notes, the trustee will select notes for redemption in\naccordance with the procedures of the depositary.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4442, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "77980bab-2d8c-45e9-93db-7bdc97d91258": {"__data__": {"id_": "77980bab-2d8c-45e9-93db-7bdc97d91258", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "118", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "602a9824-03fa-45bc-9ff5-7fed6751fd1c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "118", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "32154ee6f76b665e30b07643f8d7ae7a310e51216dd5467483e538616b8e86d1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c1dac270-0d59-48e6-ae6f-a8f502e56bea", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "118", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "c2ea67531b59c3ef46d8f6729eab4f8b52839023bd712d26d12c37e3582af54a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "If less than all of the notes are to be redeemed, in the case of certificated notes and global notes, the trustee will select notes for redemption in\naccordance with the procedures of the depositary.

See \u201cCertain Definitions\u201d below for the definitions of\ncapitalized terms used herein.\nGeneral\nThe following is a description of certain of the specific terms and conditions of the notes.\nThe notes are our senior unsecured obligations, ranking:\n\u2022equal in right of payment with any other senior unsecured indebtedness of ours, including our currently outstanding senior notes and any\nborrowings under our revolving credit facility;\n\u2022senior in right of payment to any future indebtedness of ours that is contractually subordinated to the notes;\n\u2022structurally subordinated to the claims of our subsidiaries\u2019 creditors, including trade creditors; and\n\u2022effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness of ours to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness.\nThe notes were issued in registered form without interest coupons, in denominations of \u20ac100,000 and integral multiples of \u20ac1,000 in excess\nthereof. The notes are represented by one or more registered notes in global form, but in certain limited circumstances may be represented by\nnotes in definitive form.\nThe maturity date of the notes is May 12, 2033.\nThe indenture does not limit the amount of debt that may be issued by us or our subsidiaries under the indenture or otherwise. Our subsidiaries do\nnot guarantee any of our obligations under the notes. Our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries and, therefore, we depend on the\ncash flow of our subsidiaries to meet our obligations, including our obligations under the notes. The notes are effectively subordinated in right of\npayment to all indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. Any right we have to receive\nassets of any of our subsidiaries upon the subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization (and the consequent right of the holders of the notes to\nparticipate in those assets) are effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary\u2019s creditors, except to the extent that we are recognized as\na creditor of the subsidiary.\nThe initial aggregate principal amount of the notes was \u20ac1,250,000,000. We may, without the consent of the holders, issue additional notes of any\nseries under the indenture in the future with the same terms (except for the issue date, price to public and, if applicable, the initial interest payment\ndate) and with the same CUSIP number as the other notes of such series in an unlimited aggregate principal amount; provided that if any such\nadditional notes are not fungible with such series of notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such additional notes will have a separate CUSIP\nnumber. We may also from time to time repurchase the notes of any series in tender offers, open market purchases or negotiated transactions\nwithout prior notice to holders.\nPayments on the Notes\nAll payments of interest and principal, including payments made upon any redemption of the notes, are made in euro; provided that if euro is\nunavailable to us due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control or if euro is no longer being used by the\nthen member states of the", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4151, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3dcf1570-d839-490a-bd63-74c2e32a6cb3": {"__data__": {"id_": "3dcf1570-d839-490a-bd63-74c2e32a6cb3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "132", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f0037d82-239f-4341-9e91-22365ed16de9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "132", "file_name": "booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/booking_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1508460, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "e63fd886998777de8d77b8304ee515964507ba342815b258b626e624bc45a2a1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "25618093-3183-4e00-aa64-83447fe53bd8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "94804ef341d80c75935e574905fbc9e659229956987f8393f0afd84ae1f3c891", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "European Monetary Union that have adopted euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the\ninternational banking community, then all payments in respect of the notes are to be made in U.S. dollars until euro is again available to us or so\nused.
