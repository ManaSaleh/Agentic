Business.\nOverview\nLyft, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cLyft\u201d) started a movement to revolutionize transportation. In 2012, we launched our peer-to-peer marketplace for on-\ndemand ridesharing and have continued to pioneer innovations. Today, Lyft is one of the largest multimodal transportation networks in the United States and\nCanada. We have an important purpose, which is to get riders out into the world so they can live their lives together, and to provide drivers a way to work that\ngives them control over their time and money.\nOur ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders via the Lyft mobile application (the \u201cLyft App\u201d) in cities across the United States and in\nselect cities in Canada. We have established a scaled network of users brought together by our robust technology platform (the \u201cLyft Platform\u201d) that powers\nrides and connections every day. We leverage our technology platform, the scale and density of our user network and insights from a significant number of\nrides to improve our ridesharing marketplace efficiency and develop new offerings. We\u2019ve also taken steps to ensure our network is well positioned to benefit\nfrom technological innovation in mobility.\nOur offerings on the Lyft App include an expanded set of transportation modes in select cities, such as access to a network of shared bikes and\nscooters (\u201cLight Vehicles\u201d) for shorter rides and first-mile and last-mile legs of multimodal trips.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is generated from our ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders. We collect service fees and\ncommissions from drivers for their use of our ridesharing marketplace. As drivers accept more rider leads, Gross Bookings and Rides increase, driving more\nrevenue. We also generate revenue from riders renting Light Vehicles, drivers renting vehicles through Express Drive and by making our ridesharing\nmarketplace available to organizations through our Lyft Business offerings, such as our Concierge and Lyft Pass programs. In 2021, we began generating\nrevenues from licensing and data access agreements. In 2022, we began generating revenues from the sale of bikes and bike station software and hardware\nsales substantially through our acquisition of PBSC Urban Solutions Inc (\u201cPBSC\u201d).\nRiders and drivers want and value choice, and we believe there remains an opportunity for growth in our marketplace. In September 2023, we\nlaunched Women+ Connect, a new feature that offers women and nonbinary drivers the option to turn on a preference within the Lyft App to prioritize matches\nwith nearby women and nonbinary riders. We are focused on delivering a great rideshare experience and will continue to innovate for drivers and riders,\ncreating an increasingly differentiated service over time. We are committed to building a durable, healthy and profitable business for riders, drivers and\nshareholders.\nAdditionally, we aim to advocate through our commitment to social and environmental responsibility. Through our Lyft Up initiatives, we\u2019re working\nto make sure people have access to affordable, reliable transportation to get where they need to go - no matter their income or zip code. We can\u2019t talk about\nwork that serves customer needs and social goals without mentioning our responsibility to our shared environment - the air we breathe and the resilience of\ncommunities we serve. We\u2019re working to make the Lyft Platform more sustainable by helping drivers transition to electric vehicles (\u201cEVs\u201d), riders take more\nsustainable transportation modes, and businesses reduce their carbon footprint. We\u2019ve achieved significant growth in EV rides on our platform by investing in\nEV driver incentives, expanding the Express Drive EV rental program, helping drivers access discounted fast charging and advocating for smart EV policy.\nWe believe many users are loyal to Lyft because of our values, brand and commitment to social and environmental responsibility. Our values, brand\nand focus on customer experience are key differentiators for our business. We continue to believe that users are increasingly choosing services, including a\ntransportation network, based on brand affinity and value alignment and we aim to make it easy for both drivers and riders to choose Lyft every time.\nOur Transportation Network\nOur transportation network is primarily comprised of:\n\u2022Ridesharing Marketplace. Our core offering connects drivers with riders.

Our car rental program for drivers, including those who want to drive using our platform but do not have access to a vehicle that meets\nour requirements. Through our Express Drive program, drivers can enter into rental agreements with our independently managed subsidiary,\nFlexdrive, and our rental car partners for vehicles that may be used to provide ridesharing services on the Lyft Platform.\n\u2022Light Vehicles. We have a network of shared bikes and scooters in a number of cities to address the needs of users who are looking for options that are\nmore active and often more cost-effective and efficient for shorter trips. These transportation modes can also help supplement the first-mile and last-\nmile of a multimodal trip with public transit.\nDrivers\nThe drivers on our platform are active members of their communities. They are parents, students, business owners, retirees and everything in between.\nWe work hard to serve the community of drivers on our platform, empowering them to drive on their own flexible terms while providing them the opportunity\nto focus their time on what matters most. Drivers on our platform also have key benefits, which include:\n\u2022Flexibility. We offer drivers the flexibility to generate income on their own schedule, so they can best prioritize what is important in their lives.\n\u2022Technology. Our predictive technology around ride volume and demand enables us to share key information with drivers about when and where to\ndrive to maximize their earnings on a real-time basis.\n\u2022Transparent and Consistent Pay: We've released multiple products over the years such as upfront pay where drivers can see ride information and what\nthey\u2019ll earn before accepting a ride. We also launched the Weekly Pay Statement for a clearer, more comprehensive view of driver's pay details.\n\u2022Insurance. We procure insurance that helps protect transportation network company (\u201cTNC\u201d) drivers against financial losses related to automobile\naccidents while on the platform.\n\u2022Community Standards. To help us uphold high community standards, we give both drivers and riders the opportunity to rate each other after a ride\nbooked through the Lyft App.\n\u2022Support. We offer drivers access to 24/7 support and earnings tools as well as education resources and other support to meet their personal goals.\nRiders\nRiders are as diverse and dynamic as the communities we serve. They represent all adult age groups and backgrounds and use Lyft to commute to and\nfrom work, explore their cities, spend more time at local businesses and stay out longer knowing they can get a reliable ride home. Unless otherwise stated,\nriders are passengers who request rides from drivers in our ridesharing marketplace and renters of a shared bike, scooter or automobile available on the Lyft\nApp. We work hard to provide riders with a quality experience every time they open the Lyft App, in order to earn the right to have Lyft be their transportation\nnetwork of choice. Riders on our platform also have key benefits, which include:\n\u2022Selection and Convenience. We designed the Lyft App with a focus on simplicity, efficiency and convenience. Our proprietary technology efficiently\nmatches riders with drivers through advanced dispatching algorithms providing faster arrival times, localized pricing and maximum availability.\nAdditional transportation modes, such as Light Vehicles, offer more options for shorter trips. We also continue to launch new features, such as\nWomen+ Connect. The more rides that are taken on our platform, the better we are able to offer riders personalized experiences most suitable to their\ntrip.\n\u2022Availability and Reliability. We strive to ensure that riders can get a ride when they want one. We leverage our proprietary dispatch platform and data\nto help drivers and riders connect efficiently and reduce wait times. As of November 2023, scheduled rides to the airport are backed by our on-time\npickup promise in certain major markets. If a ride is more than ten minutes late for a scheduled pick-up, we will offer up to $100 in Lyft credits to\nmake up for it.\n\u2022Affordability. Our platform empowers riders to choose from a broad set of transportation options to easily optimize for cost, comfort and time. Wait &\nSave, a substantial and growing portion of rides, offers riders a way to save money when they aren\u2019t in a hurry.\n\u2022Safety. Since day one, we have worked continuously to enhance the safety of our platform and the ridesharing industry by developing innovative\nproducts, policies and processes. We have a dedicated safety response team, a partnership with ADT, Inc. (\u201cADT\u201d) to aid in emergencies, and work\nwith leading national organizations to inform our safety policies. We are always working to make Lyft as safe as we can.\nBusiness\n6", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4778, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5fc27d94-14fb-4606-8658-dee5cef7d831": {"__data__": {"id_": "5fc27d94-14fb-4606-8658-dee5cef7d831", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9cb6f093-3949-434c-9e0c-d774641031be", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "811d3644b0200141efb12f93daa3883a4d30c06d81fafc42029eab5afe3fb652", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We work with organizations across a wide range of industries to deliver transportation solutions.

We strive to provide a full range of price points and ride experiences such as\nWait & Save, which allows riders to save money by waiting for a ride, and Priority Pickup, which provides a premium experience by allowing riders\nto pay for prioritized pickup. We plan to continue to grow our ridesharing marketplace by prioritizing competitive service levels and attracting and\nretaining more drivers and riders on our network. Additionally, we continue to evaluate ways to expand our network coverage beyond the geographies\nand markets we currently serve.

We also\nprovide drivers with a suite of resources, including access to our on-demand, 24/7 support through our Driver app, to ensure drivers have the resources\nthey need before taking the road.\n\u2022Invest in our Marketplace Technology. Our investments in our proprietary technology allow us to deliver a convenient and high-quality experience to\ndrivers and riders and additional investments in our payments and data science capabilities have been central to making our network more efficient\nand seamless to use.\nCompetition\nThe market for Transportation-as-a-Service (\u201cTaaS\u201d) networks is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, shifting\nlevels of demand and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. We expect competition to continue, both from current competitors and new entrants\nin the market that may be well-established and enjoy greater resources or other strategic advantages. If we are unable to anticipate or successfully react to these\ncompetitive challenges in a timely manner, our competitive position could weaken, or fail to improve, and we could experience a decline in revenue or growth\nstagnation that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur main ridesharing competitor in the United States and Canada is Uber, though we also compete with other ridesharing transportation network\ncompanies, and taxi cab and livery companies as well as traditional automotive manufacturers. Our main competitors in the bike and scooter sharing market\ninclude Lime, Bird, Fifteen and Tier. We also compete with other manufacturers of bike and scooter sharing equipment for sales of such equipment, particularly\nin markets outside of the United States.\nAdditionally, there are other non-U.S.-based TaaS network companies, non-ridesharing transportation network companies and traditional automotive\nmanufacturers that may expand into the United States and Canada. There are also a number of companies developing autonomous vehicle technology and TaaS\nofferings that may compete with us in the future, including Alphabet (Waymo), which is offering autonomous ride-hailing services in certain markets, Amazon\n(Zoox), Apple, Aurora, Baidu, General Motors (Cruise), Motional, and Tesla as well as many other technology companies and automobile manufacturers and\nsuppliers. We anticipate continued challenges from current competitors as well as from new entrants into the TaaS market.\nWe believe we can compete favorably. However, many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater brand name\nrecognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets and established marketing relationships, access to larger customer bases and significantly\ngreater resources for the development of their offerings.

We also benefit from positive word of mouth in the existing Lyft rider and driver communities.\n8", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4156, "end_char_idx": 5768, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3a9736c7-3f44-4a20-9e65-6d4839797769": {"__data__": {"id_": "3a9736c7-3f44-4a20-9e65-6d4839797769", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1cc49bae-34d9-4d73-858b-0313a0f75465", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "6ccec1030d930bfae9dff8174418924d67402c2bb72f86fd7aef7c61debf42ac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Our marketing efforts educate people about Lyft products in creative and memorable ways and generate greater brand awareness among potential\ndrivers and riders. Our brand marketing includes but is not limited to Lyft-produced content, culture and entertainment partnerships, marketing partnerships,\nand outdoor advertisements. We use specific channels and initiatives so we can measure the impact of our marketing spend. We attract new drivers and riders\nthrough referrals, partnerships, display advertising, radio, video, social media, email, search engine optimization, keyword search campaigns, and more. We\ncontinue to engage with current riders through a variety of initiatives, including emails, in-app notifications, social media content, promotions, and more.\nOur Commitment to Safety\nA strong guiding principle since day one has been to build a community that drivers and riders trust. Trust is the foundation of our relationship with\ndrivers and riders on our platform, and we take significant measures every day that are focused on their safety.\nTo ensure we are delivering exceptional service levels and upholding high quality standards, we have established our Safety and Customer Care, or\nSCC, team as a key part of our organization. SCC is in charge of fielding safety and customer support inquiries and is available through multiple channels,\nincluding via self-service and assisted support directly within our apps. SCC aims to listen to customers, quickly resolve problems when they occur and\nmaintain trust with drivers and riders. Some measures we take to promote the safety of riders and drivers on the platform include:\n\u2022Annual background checks and ongoing criminal monitoring. Every driver is required to pass a professionally administered criminal background\ncheck before they drive and each year after that. In the United States, continuous criminal monitoring allows us to quickly deactivate drivers with\ndisqualifying criminal convictions. Similarly, in the United States, we also continuously check driving records so that we can promptly identify and\nremove drivers from the platform upon detection of a disqualifying violation.\n\u2022Share location. The Lyft App provides real-time ride tracking, so riders can share their exact location and route with family and friends. Once a user\nenables this feature, a user\u2019s trusted contacts (who they shared their location with) can see trip status and where they are on the map.\n\u2022Emergency help, supported by ADT. If a rider or driver feels uncomfortable or needs emergency assistance at any point, they are able to quickly\nconnect with an ADT security professional through the Lyft App, silently or by voice. If someone signals they need help and subsequently does not\nrespond to a call or text from ADT, ADT will contact 911 and share the user\u2019s location and other relevant information.\n\u2022Live safety support and specialized support and advocacy. Our Safety team is standing by, ready to help via phone or chat, and every member of the\nSafety team is a credentialed victim advocate. Each member has training in trauma-informed care.\n\u2022Smart trip check-in. We monitor rides for unusual activity, like long stops or route deviations, and in some instances, if we notice a ride irregularity,\nwe reach out to riders and drivers directly. We will ask the rider or driver if they need help, and, if appropriate, connect them to emergency assistance\nor our own Safety team.\n\u2022Hidden contact information and ride history. The Lyft App hides contact information for both the rider and driver before, during and after the ride.\nWhile riders and drivers are able to call or text one another through the app, personal information, including real user phone numbers, are not\nrevealed. Drivers are also not able to see a rider\u2019s drop-off location, whether it\u2019s a specific address or a cross-street, after the ride is complete.\n\u2022Two-way ratings and feedback. At the end of each trip, drivers and riders are prompted to rate their ride on the scale of one to five stars. Any rider or\ndriver who submits a rating of four stars or fewer is prompted to provide more details. Anyone who rates a rider or driver three stars or fewer will\nnever be matched with that individual again through the app.\n9", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4247, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "79914277-89d5-4336-afff-e269cdc785c9": {"__data__": {"id_": "79914277-89d5-4336-afff-e269cdc785c9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "822f28fd-9274-48fa-b704-74dd831fb86a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "fdc2788689d1deb4a05a394f9ef81773858a11e4b2dc2ff6bc731c878b4c6ca0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a6949617-4451-4b57-9bb2-48cb75c9d401", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1f3f4bb40f102e42d42d15df916fe39209ad391b98f75d0e0e6889a271a401a2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Government Regulation\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions.

In 2018, California passed first-of-its-kind legislation (the \u201cCalifornia Clean Miles Standard\u201d) to\nmandate that TNCs increase the percentage of zero-emission vehicles on their platforms, with additional requirements to reduce their GHG emissions on a\nGHG per passenger-mile basis.

The\nworkplace environment has changed significantly in the last couple of years and we have changed our philosophy to reflect what we believe will produce the\nbest results for our employees and business moving forward. Thus, in 2023, we welcomed employees back to the office and have implemented a hybrid model\nwhere employees have the flexibility to work from home. As of December 31, 2023, we had 2,945 employees and we maintain additional offices in multiple\nlocations in the U.S. and internationally in Montreal, Canada, Mexico City, Mexico, Kyiv, Ukraine, Berlin, Germany, Munich, Germany and Minsk, Belarus.\nNone of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we\nconsider our relations with our employees to be positive.\nWe believe that achieving more diversity in workforce representation is an important priority. We are a company with a diverse customer base, and the\nmore our employees reflect that diversity, the better we can serve our customers, ultimately making our business stronger. As of December 31, 2023, our\nemployee base was 57% male and 40% female, and women represented 42% of our leadership overall. The ethnicity of our U.S. employees was 46% White,\n32% Asian, 9% Hispanic or Latinx, 7% Black, and 5% two or more races, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander.

As of December 31, 2023, employees who did not disclose gender represented approximately 3% of total employees, and\nemployees who did not disclose ethnicity represented approximately 1% of total U.S. employees.\nWe strive to build a more representative workforce which requires an intentional and comprehensive effort to reach and recruit outstanding candidates,\ndevelop talent internally, and open up pathways for advancement.

We are working to make the Lyft Platform more sustainable by helping drivers transition to EVs, riders take more sustainable modes, and\nbusinesses reduce their carbon footprint.\nThe rides that we facilitate on our platform make up over 95% of Lyft\u2019s carbon emissions. Transitioning these rides from gas-powered to electric\nvehicles is the one of the best ways we can contribute long-term toward a cleaner planet.\nOver 8 million riders rode in an EV in 2023. Rides in electric vehicles generally get higher ratings and tips compared to rides in hybrids and gas cars.\nOver 20% of rides on the Lyft Platform are currently in a hybrid or an EV. In April 2023, we launched Green, where riders can select an EV or hybrid vehicle,\nspecifically for business travelers, and in January 2024, we expanded Green to nearly 40 airports in North America.\nBecause we stand at a pivotal moment in the fight against climate change, Lyft strives to grow EVs on the platform. In 2020, we made a commitment\nto reach 100% EVs across the Lyft Platform by the end of 2030. We still believe in the long-term transition to EVs, but now do not see a path to completing our\ntransition to 100% EVs by 2030 given the current EV landscape. Over the course of 2024 and 2025, we will invest an additional $80 million total to support\nEV drivers and encourage gas-powered drivers to make the switch. We expect this investment to help us reach 100 million all-time EV rides on the platform by\nthe end of 2025. Most of this funding will go to drivers in states that are committed to electrifying, developing infrastructure, and growing EV adoption as\nquickly as possible.\nSocial\nLyft\u2019s purpose is to get people out into the world so they can live their lives together, and provide drivers a meaningful way to earn that gives them\ncontrol over their time and money. We\u2019re constantly thinking about the role we play in our customers\u2019 lives.\nFor riders, social interaction improves physical and mental health. We\u2019re making it easier to get out of the house, and the hundreds of millions of rides\nwe facilitated in 2023 connected people with friends, family, and coworkers. Everyday encounters like these help people feel happier and more connected to\ntheir community.\nFor drivers, Lyft is part of the economic fabric of millions of lives. Drivers may be students putting themselves through college, parents looking for a\nway to earn while their kids are in school, or seniors interested in meeting new people. The flexibility to work on their own schedules is a core benefit of\ndriving with Lyft, and millions of drivers use the platform to support their families or build toward their dreams. We keep working to understand who drivers\nare and how they use Lyft through our annual Economic Impact Report.\nWe want to improve the lives of everyone we interact with, but know that targeted programs can have an outsized impact. Through our Lyft Up\ninitiative, we\u2019re working to provide riders access to affordable, reliable transportation to get where they need to go \u2014 no matter their age, income, zip, or postal\ncode. In 2023, Lyft provided access to millions of discounted or donated rideshare, bikeshare, and shared scooter rides to people in need. We provided access to\nmillions of discounted or donated rideshare, bikeshare, and shared scooter rides to help people in need. Some of our current Lyft Up programs assist the\ncommunity by providing rides to and from jobs, job interviews and trainings, the grocery store for those living in food-insecure areas, and by providing\ndiscounted bikeshare memberships and heavily discounted electric bikes to income eligible riders. Other Lyft Up programs provide donated ride credits to\nresettlement agencies and other community based organizations helping refugees access essential needs and services or relief rides in the aftermath of natural\nor manmade disasters.\nCorporate Governance\nOur board of directors regularly evaluates our environmental, social, and corporate governance policies to make sure they fit into our strategy of\ndriving long-term stockholder value and align with our core values. More information about our directors, executive officers and corporate governance will be\nincluded in our definitive Proxy Statement for our 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\nCorporate Information\nWe were incorporated in 2007 as Bounder Web, Inc., a Delaware corporation. In 2008, we changed our name to Zimride, Inc.

Related to General Economic Factors\nA deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur business and results of operations are subject to global economic conditions. Deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, including slower growth or\nrecession, inflation and related increases in interest rates, increases to fuel and other energy costs or vehicle costs, changes in the labor market or decreases in\nconsumer spending power or confidence, are likely to result in decreased discretionary spending and reduced demand for our platform. Further, changes in\ncorporate spending, including cost-cuts and layoffs, may adversely impact business travel, commuting and other business-related expenditures and impact our\nLyft Business customers. In addition, uncertainty and volatility in the banking and financial services sectors, inflation and higher interest rates, increased fuel\nand other energy costs, increased labor and benefits costs and increased insurance costs have, and may continue to, put pressure on economic conditions, which\nhas led, and could lead, to greater operating expenses. For example, inflation has increased and is expected to further increase medical costs and vehicle repair\ncosts, including increased prices of new and used vehicle parts, which has resulted in increases in our insurance costs. Similarly, these factors, as well as\nincreased fuel costs, increase our costs as well as costs for drivers on our platform. Many of these factors are out of our control and make it difficult to\naccurately forecast gross bookings, revenues and operating results, particularly in the long-term, and could negatively affect our ability to meet our target\noperating performance and our (and our strategic partners\u2019) ability to make decisions about future investments and strategies. Further, we may need to make\nchanges to our business to respond to these conditions and be able to compete effectively. For example, as a result of the increase in gas prices at certain points\nin 2022, in order to support drivers on our platform, we implemented a temporary per ride fuel surcharge in most markets, which we removed in September\n2022. Similarly, we have adjusted our pricing in response to competitive pressures caused by changes in our marketplace, which has in the past contributed to a\ndecline in our revenue and may cause a decline in revenue in future quarters. An economic downturn resulting in a prolonged recessionary period would likely\nhave a further adverse effect on our revenue, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its related effects disrupted and harmed our business, financial condition and results of operations, and, in certain respects,\nour business has not recovered. We are unable to predict the extent to which our business, financial condition and results of operations have experienced\nlong-term impacts.\nOur business, operations and financial performance were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health responses, such\nas travel bans, travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders. The pandemic and these responses, as well as related behavioral and social changes that continue\nto evolve, have caused, and could continue to cause, a number of impacts to our business and our platform, including, but not limited to, those discussed below.\n\u2022The pandemic led to declines in certain travel, including commuting and business and leisure travel, resulting in decreased demand for our platform\nand unpredictable earning opportunities for drivers on our platform. While travel has recovered to some degree, shifts towards remote or hybrid work\nenvironments, or other behavioral changes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, have negatively impacted the frequency and nature of demand for\ntravel, including commuting and business travel, and may reduce our long-term market opportunity. Additionally, the recovery of demand for our\nplatform and the impact of the broader economic environment on rider and driver behavior varies by geography and certain markets where we have\nhistorically seen significant demand have been, and may continue to be, slow to recover or grow.\n\u2022Driver behaviors also shifted throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to imbalanced levels of driver availability on our platform relative to rider\ndemand at times in certain markets. Limited driver availability has negatively impacted service levels, which led us to provide additional incentives to\nattract and retain drivers, and has also decreased demand for vehicles rented to drivers through our Express Drive program.\n\u2022We, along with many other employers, modified our business practices as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many of which have continued in the\npost-pandemic environment. We have permitted corporate employees in nearly all of our locations to work in a hybrid in-office and remote\nenvironment, limited employee travel, and shifted toward holding virtual events and meetings.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5051, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9a1d36bb-a6af-4ef4-9cf2-98c256d20089": {"__data__": {"id_": "9a1d36bb-a6af-4ef4-9cf2-98c256d20089", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ebc5f295-5966-4a38-bd23-2f02555056f0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "5ff7caf37215b4507d05614da79abb31eb3a68ffb63a3d3b786d67001d8b8cee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "dfa9a9a9-65fb-47ed-912d-b7cd4f9dc1fb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "c030ee87eaf94fa10be8fc9b0ae0a359afd9b5853a96cbbf2c00918772ceebda", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\u2022Driver behaviors also shifted throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to imbalanced levels of driver availability on our platform relative to rider\ndemand at times in certain markets.

Further, the development of autonomous vehicle-related technology\nwas directly impacted by pandemic-related health and safety conditions and shelter-in-place restrictions, and continues to experience indirect impacts\nsuch as decisions by current or potential partners to reduce investments in developing and deploying autonomous vehicle-related technology due to\nmacroeconomic factors.\n\u2022The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related behavioral and social changes on our business, riders and drivers on our platform, and\nour business partners will depend on many factors outside of our control, such as shifts in consumer or business behavior and macroeconomic factors\ndirectly or indirectly related to the pandemic.\nOur business could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, economic downturns or other unexpected events.\nA significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, hurricane, tornado, flood or significant power outage, could disrupt our operations, mobile\nnetworks, the Internet or the operations of our third-party technology providers. In particular, our corporate headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay\nArea, a region known for seismic activity and increasingly for fires. The impact of climate change may increase these risks. In addition, any public health\ncrises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, other epidemics, political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war and other political or social instability and other\ngeopolitical developments, or other catastrophic events, whether in the United States or abroad, could adversely affect our operations or the economy as a\nwhole. For example, we have offices and employees in Belarus and Ukraine that have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the current war in the\nregion, including displacement of our employees. The impact of any natural disaster, act of terrorism or other disruption to us or our third-party providers\u2019\nabilities could result in driver supply and rider demand imbalances, decreased demand for our offerings or a delay in the provision of our offerings, or increase\nour costs and operating expenses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. All of the aforementioned risks may\nbe further increased if our disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate.\nRisks Related to Operational Factors\nOur limited operating history and our evolving business make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter.\nWhile we have primarily focused on ridesharing since our ridesharing marketplace launched in 2012, our business continues to evolve. We regularly\nexpand our platform features, offerings and services and change our pricing methodologies. Through the acquisition of PBSC in May 2022, we expanded our\nbusiness to include licensing of certain of our technology and sales of bikes and stations. In recent periods, we have also reevaluated and changed our cost\nstructure and focused our business model.

Further, because we have an\nevolving financial model and operate in a rapidly evolving market, any predictions about our future gross bookings, revenue, expenses and earnings may not be\nas accurate as they would be if we had a static financial model or operated in a more predictable market. We have encountered in the past, and will encounter in\nthe future, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies with limited operating histories in rapidly changing industries. If our\nassumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate our business, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks\nsuccessfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be\nadversely affected.\nOur financial performance in recent periods may not be indicative of future performance, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in\nthe future.\nPrior to COVID-19, we grew rapidly. In 2020, due to COVID-19 and the related government and public health measures, our revenue declined\nsignificantly. Although our revenue has since recovered, the timeline for a full recovery of rideshare demand, driver supply and other aspects of our business in\neach of our markets is uncertain. Accordingly, our recent revenue growth rate and financial performance, including prior to the effects of COVID-19, the\ndecline related to COVID-19 and recent growth rates compared to periods in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, may not be indicative of our future\nperformance. Further, we have incurred net losses each year since our inception, and we expect that our financial performance, including Adjusted EBITDA,\nwill continue to fluctuate in future periods. We can provide no assurances that we will achieve or maintain Adjusted EBITDA profitability in the future, on a\nquarterly or annual basis, or that we will ever achieve profitability on a GAAP basis.\nWhile we remain focused on operating efficiently, our expenses will likely increase in the future as we develop and launch new offerings and platform\nfeatures, expand in existing and new markets and continue to invest in our platform and customer engagement. In addition, certain costs, such as insurance and\ndriver pay and incentives have increased or fluctuated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, macroeconomic factors and the development and maturation of\nour business and the rideshare industry and may continue to do so. We may be unable to accurately predict these costs and our investments may not result in\nincreased revenue or growth in our business. For example, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs and expenses associated with the\npassage of Proposition 22 in California, HB 2076 in Washington and implementation of operational changes as part of an agreement with the New York\nAttorney General, including providing drivers in these states with new earnings opportunities and protections, including contributions towards on-the-job injury\ninsurance, other benefits and minimum guaranteed earnings. In addition, various jurisdictions have introduced legislation setting high earnings standards and\nincreasing other costs to the business including insurance. Due to various factors, including inflation, we anticipate that our insurance costs will continue to\nincrease and will impact our profitability. Furthermore, we have expanded over time to include more asset-intensive offerings such as our network of Light\nVehicles and Flexdrive. These offerings and programs require significant capital investments and recurring costs, including debt payments, maintenance,\ndepreciation, asset life and asset replacement costs, and if we are not able to maintain sufficient levels of utilization of such assets, such offerings are otherwise\nnot successful or we decide to shut down any such offerings, our investments may not generate sufficient returns and our financial condition may be adversely\naffected. In addition to the above, a determination in, resolution of, or settlement of, any legal proceeding related to driver classification matters may require us\nto significantly alter our existing business model and operations (including potentially suspending or ceasing operations in impacted jurisdictions), increase our\ncosts and impact our ability to add qualified drivers to our platform and grow our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations, and our ability to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4938, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7716dff1-d8a7-4d41-99a2-8e770c891419": {"__data__": {"id_": "7716dff1-d8a7-4d41-99a2-8e770c891419", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3d74d98f-b665-4858-881e-762b2fc6cb2b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "1e3859ded8b64f80d6e7a8b38587cfd5ad0e3238c50366933cea100fb498d8fb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d5c26cb5-2ce1-4d94-9480-6b2592fc5451", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "cad74d5e71aa84ce6911ea1c106e50df2505c934c488788038b0dd76f8d67ffc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "These offerings and programs require significant capital investments and recurring costs, including debt payments, maintenance,\ndepreciation, asset life and asset replacement costs, and if we are not able to maintain sufficient levels of utilization of such assets, such offerings are otherwise\nnot successful or we decide to shut down any such offerings, our investments may not generate sufficient returns and our financial condition may be adversely\naffected.

Ongoing\nlitigation seeking to reclassify drivers as employees is pending in multiple jurisdictions, including as described in the \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d subheading in Note\n9, Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If such litigation is successful in one\nor more jurisdictions, we may be required to classify drivers as employees rather than independent contractors in those jurisdictions, and we may incur\nsignificant expenses to resolve the matters at issue in the litigation. If this occurs, we may need to develop and implement an employment model that we have\nnot historically used or to cease operations, whether temporarily or permanently, in affected jurisdictions. We may face specific risks relating to our ability to\nonboard drivers as employees, our ability to partner with third-party organizations to source drivers and our ability to effectively utilize employee drivers to\nmeet rider demand.\nIf drivers are unsatisfied with our partners, including our third-party vehicle rental partners, our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and to\nincrease their utilization of our platform could be adversely affected. Further, incentives we provide to attract drivers could fail to attract and retain qualified\ndrivers or fail to increase utilization, or could have other unintended adverse consequences. In addition, changes in certain laws and regulations, including\nimmigration, labor and employment laws or background check requirements, may result in a shift or decrease in the pool of qualified drivers, which may result\nin increased competition for qualified drivers or higher costs of recruitment, operation and retention. As part of our business operations or research and\ndevelopment efforts, data on the vehicle may be collected and drivers may be uncomfortable or unwilling to drive knowing that data is being collected. Other\nfactors outside of our control, such as concerns about personal health and safety, increases in the price of gasoline, vehicles or insurance, or concerns about the\navailability of government or other assistance programs if drivers continue to drive on our platform, may also reduce the number of drivers on our platform or\ntheir utilization of our platform, or impact our ability to onboard new drivers.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5186, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "af101f2f-d5c5-4f0c-aae6-fc65fb195cd5": {"__data__": {"id_": "af101f2f-d5c5-4f0c-aae6-fc65fb195cd5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f1520769-6fba-448b-95c4-6f4fed211e63", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "cefdfba74fe2dfa4b2b3bd9e9f78ec599a29318635467b94e799343c0f8a3d37", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2e90a024-ebd3-457e-9e0c-08b0c574715c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "c41b46d0c666d9c5d50ab506ac59aeeefa5ba41fb06c72be99bcd9640459702b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In addition, changes in certain laws and regulations, including\nimmigration, labor and employment laws or background check requirements, may result in a shift or decrease in the pool of qualified drivers, which may result\nin increased competition for qualified drivers or higher costs of recruitment, operation and retention.

To comply with certain United States and Canadian province insurance regulatory requirements for auto-related\nrisks, we procure a number of third-party insurance policies which provide the required coverage in such jurisdictions. In all U.S. states, our insurance\nsubsidiary reinsures a portion, which may change from time to time, of the auto-related risk from some third-party insurance providers.

Any of the\nforegoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges to our pricing could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain qualified drivers and riders.\nDemand for our offerings is highly sensitive to the price of rides, the rates for time and distance driven, incentives paid to drivers and the fees we\ncharge drivers. Many factors, including operating costs, legal and regulatory requirements or constraints and our current and future competitors\u2019 pricing and\nmarketing strategies including increased incentives for drivers, could significantly affect our pricing strategies. Certain of our competitors offer, or may in the\nfuture offer, lower-priced or a broader range of offerings. Similarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to attract or retain\nqualified drivers and riders at a lower cost than we do. This includes the use of algorithms to set dynamic prices for riders and earnings for drivers that are\ndependent on various factors, such as the route, time of day, and pick-up and drop-off locations of riders. From time to time, we have made pricing changes and\nspent significant amounts on marketing and both rider and driver incentives, and we expect that, from time to time, we will be required, through competition,\nregulation or otherwise, to reduce the price of rides for riders, increase the incentives we pay to drivers on our platform or reduce the fees we charge the drivers\non our platform, or to increase our marketing and other expenses to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders in response to competitive pressures. These\nactions may adversely affect our business and financial results and may not have the desired benefits. At times, in certain geographic markets, we have offered,\nand may continue to offer, driver incentives that cause the total amount of the fare that a driver retains, combined with the driver incentives a driver receives\nfrom us, to increase, at times meeting or exceeding the amount of gross bookings we generate for a given ride. Furthermore, the economic sensitivity of drivers\nand riders on our platform may vary by geographic location, and as we expand, our pricing methodologies may not enable us to compete effectively in these\nlocations. Local regulations may affect our pricing in certain geographic locations, which could amplify these effects. For example, state and local laws and\nregulations regarding pricing limitations during a government declared State of Emergency have imposed limits on prices for certain services, and state and\nlocal laws and regulations have imposed minimum earnings standards for drivers, which, at times, have caused us to increase prices in certain markets,\nincluding California, New York and Washington. We have tested or launched, and expect to in the future test or launch, new pricing strategies and initiatives,\nsuch as our earnings commitment, subscription packages and driver or rider loyalty programs. We have also modified, and expect to in the future modify,\nexisting pricing methodologies, such as our up-front pricing policy.

For example, although we have exclusive rights to operate bike or scooter sharing programs in certain\njurisdictions, we have faced competition in contravention of such rights and have incurred costs to defend against such challenges. A negative determination in\nother legal disputes regarding bike and scooter sharing, including an adverse determination regarding our existing rights to operate, could adversely affect our\ncompetitive position and results of operations. Additionally, we may from time to time be denied permits to operate, or be temporarily restricted from operating\ndue to public health and safety measures, our bike share program or scooter share program in certain jurisdictions. While we do not expect any denial or\nsuspension in an individual region to have a material impact, these denials or suspensions in the aggregate could adversely affect our business and results of\noperations. Even if we are able to successfully develop and implement our network of Light Vehicles, there may be heightened public skepticism of this\nnascent service offering. In particular, there could be negative public perception surrounding bike and scooter sharing, including the overall safety and the\npotential for injuries occurring as a result of accidents involving an increased number of bikes and scooters on the road, and the general safety of the bikes and\nscooters themselves. Such negative public perception may result from incidents on our platform or incidents involving our competitors\u2019 offerings.\nWe design and contract to manufacture bikes and scooters using a limited number of external suppliers, and a continuous, stable and cost-effective\nsupply of bikes and scooters that meets our standards is critical to our operations. We expect to continue to rely on external suppliers in the future. There can be\nno assurance we will be able to maintain our existing relationships with these suppliers and continue to be able to source our bikes and scooters on a stable\nbasis, at a reasonable price or at all. We also design and contract to manufacture certain assets related to our network of Light Vehicles and we rely on a small\nnumber of suppliers, and in some instances a sole supplier, for components and manufacturing services. Similarly, we rely on external vendors to provide field\nservices to our bike and scooter operations. There can be no assurance we will be able to maintain our existing relationships with these vendors. Also, from\ntime to time we transition these services in one or more geographies from one vendor to another, and the transition process could interrupt or otherwise\nadversely affect our operations.\nThe revenue we generate from our network of Light Vehicles may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to, among other things, seasonal factors\nincluding weat her. Our limited operating history makes it difficult for us to assess the exact nature or extent of the effects of seasonality on our network of\nLight Vehicles, however, we generally experience a decline in demand for our bike and scooter rentals over the winter season and an increase during more\ntemperate and dry seasons. Additionally, from time to time we may re-evaluate the markets in which we operate and the performance of our network of Light\nVehicles, and we have discontinued and may in the future discontinue operations in certain markets as a result of such evaluations. For example, in July 2022,\nNovember 2022 and March 2023, we discontinued our shared scooter programs in San Diego and Los Angeles and our shared bike and scooter program in\nMinneapolis, respectively, due to a number of factors including onerous contractual requirements, institutionalized theft, and lack of public investment.

Autonomous\ndriving is a new and evolving market, which makes it difficult to predict its acceptance, its growth, and the magnitude and timing of necessary investments and\nother trends, including when it may be more broadly or commercially available. Our initiatives may not perform as expected, which would reduce the return on\nour investments in this area and our current or future partners may decide to terminate or scale back their partnerships with us.

Following the sale of our Level 5 self-driving vehicle division in\n2021, we no longer develop our own autonomous vehicle technology, so we must develop and maintain partnerships with other companies to offer autonomous\nvehicle technology on our platforms, and if we are unable to do so, or if we do so at a slower pace or at a higher cost or if our technology is less capable\nrelative to our competitors, or if our efforts to optimize our strategy with regard to our autonomous vehicle technology development are not successful, our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Likewise, if our current or future autonomous vehicle technology partners\nare delayed or prevented from developing autonomous vehicle technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely\naffected. For example, a general decrease in available capital, as well as an increase in regulatory scrutiny could delay or prevent the development of\nautonomous vehicle technology by our partners.\nThe autonomous vehicle industry may not continue to develop, or autonomous vehicles may not be adopted by the market, which could adversely affect our\nprospects, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have invested, and plan to continue to invest, in the development of autonomous vehicle-related technology for use on our platform. Autonomous\ndriving involves a complex set of technologies, including the continued development of sensing, computing and control technology. We have relied on building\nstrategic partnerships with third-party developers of such technologies, as such technologies are costly and in varying stages of maturity. There is no assurance\nthat these current or future partnerships will result in the development of market-viable technologies or commercial success in a timely manner or at all.

Any of the foregoing risks\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Express Drive program and potential future fleet businesses expose us to certain risks, including reductions in the utilization of vehicles in the fleets.\nFor the Express Drive vehicle rental program for drivers operated by our independently managed subsidiary, Flexdrive, a portion of the fleet is\nsourced from a range of auto manufacturers. In addition, we have established environmental programs that may limit the range of auto manufacturers or\nvehicles that Flexdrive sources or purchases from. To the extent that any of these auto manufacturers significantly curtail production, increase the cost of\npurchasing cars or decline to provide cars to Flexdrive on terms or at prices consistent with past agreements, despite sourcing vehicles from the used car market\nand other efforts to mitigate, Flexdrive may be unable to obtain a sufficient number of vehicles for Lyft to operate the Express Drive business without\nsignificantly increasing fleet costs or reducing volumes. Similarly, where events, such as natural disasters or public health crises such as the COVID-19\npandemic, make operating rental locations difficult or impossible, or adversely impact rider demand, the demand for or Flexdrive\u2019s ability to make vehicles\navailable for rent through the Express Drive program has been and could continue to be adversely affected, resulting in reduced utilization of the vehicles in the\nfleets.\nAlthough new vehicle inventory supply is improving, Flexdrive has previously experienced and may in the future experience production and delivery\ndelays which can hinder its ability to meet demand and grow the fleet. New vehicle production delays also lead to holding onto existing vehicles longer which\nin turn leads to increased costs relating to those vehicles.\nThe costs of the fleet vehicles may also be adversely impacted by the relative strength of the used car market. Flexdrive currently sells vehicles\nthrough auctions, third-party resellers and other channels in the used vehicle marketplace. Such channels may not produce stable used vehicle prices and\nFlexdrive has experienced a softening in the used car market. It may be difficult to estimate the residual value of vehicles used in ridesharing, such as those\nrented to drivers through our Express Drive program.

Any of these risks could cause us to lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment transactions or make\ntimely payments to drivers on our platform, any of which could make our platform less convenient and attractive to users and adversely affect our ability to\nattract and retain qualified drivers and riders.\nNearly all rider payments and driver payouts are made by credit card, debit card or through third-party payment services, which subjects us to certain\npayment network or service provider operating rules, to certain regulations and to the risk of fraud. We may in the future offer new payment options to riders\nthat may be subject to additional operating rules, regulations and risks.

Similarly, in the event that our strategic partners experience\na disruption in their operations, our ability to continue providing certain product offerings could become constrained. If we cannot find alternate partners, we\nmay not be able to meet the demand for these product offerings, and as a result, these offerings and our platform may become less attractive.

Furthermore, new driver or rider demands regarding service or platform features, the availability of superior competitive offerings\nor a deterioration in the quality of our offerings or our ability to bring new or enhanced offerings to market quickly and efficiently could negatively affect the\nattractiveness of our platform and the economics of our business and require us to make substantial changes to and additional investments in our offerings or\nour business model. In addition, we frequently experiment with and test different offerings and marketing strategies. For example, in September 2023 we\nlaunched Women+ Connect, an offering with a goal of increasing women drivers on the platform by helping match women and nonbinary drivers with women\nand nonbinary passengers. If these experiments and tests are unsuccessful, or if the offerings and strategies we introduce based on the results of such\nexperiments and tests do not perform as expected, our ability to attract new qualified drivers and new riders, retain existing qualified drivers and existing riders\nand maintain or increase utilization of our offerings may be adversely affected.\nDeveloping and launching new offerings or enhancements to the existing offerings on our platform involves significant risks and uncertainties,\nincluding risks related to the reception of such offerings by existing and potential future drivers and riders, increases in operational complexity, unanticipated\ndelays or challenges in implementing such offerings or enhancements, increased strain on our operational and internal resources (including an impairment of\nour ability to accurately forecast rider demand and the number of drivers using our platform), our dependence on strategic commercial partnerships, and\nnegative publicity in the event such new or enhanced offerings are perceived to be unsuccessful. We have scaled our business rapidly, and significant new\ninitiatives have in the past resulted in, and in the future may result in, operational challenges affecting our business. In addition, developing and launching new\nofferings and enhancements to our existing offerings may involve significant up-front capital investments and such investments may not generate sufficient\nreturns on investment. Further, from time to time we may reevaluate, discontinue and/or reduce these investments and decide to discontinue one or more\nofferings. For example, we shut down our roadside assistance offering, vehicle services offering, and parking offering, all of which were initially launched in\n2021. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders, our ability to increase\nutilization of our offerings and our visibility into expected results of operations, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.

These new offerings have required us to develop new expertise and\nmarketing and operational strategies, and have subjected us to new laws, regulations and risks. For example, our Wait & Save offering, which enables riders to\nopt for a longer wait time but pay a lower fare than for a Standard ride, while drivers earn the same as they do for a Standard ride, involves inherent challenges\nin predicting the future locations of drivers. We also face the risk that our network of Light Vehicles, our Nearby Transit offering, which integrates third-party\npublic transit data into the Lyft App, and other future transportation offerings could reduce the use of our ridesharing offering.

Bad actors use increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities, including those involving\npersonal information, such as unauthorized use of another person\u2019s identity, account information or payment information and unauthorized acquisition or use of\ncredit or debit card details, bank account information and mobile phone numbers and accounts. Under current card payment practices, we may be liable for\nrides facilitated on our platform with fraudulent credit card data, even if the associated financial institution approved the credit card transaction.

As we do not control the driver\u2019s actions at any point in the transaction to limit the\ntime and distance for the trip, we take on risks related to the driver\u2019s actions which may not be fully mitigated. Additionally, Shared Rides, a limited-scope\noffering for business-to-business partnerships in select markets, enables unrelated parties traveling along similar routes to generate a discounted fare at the cost\nof possibly longer travel times. The fare charged for the Shared Ride is decoupled from the payment made to the driver as we do not adjust the driver payment\nbased on the success or failure of a match.

We rely heavily on a software engineering practice known as \u201ccontinuous deployment,\u201d which refers to the frequent release of\nour software code, sometimes multiple times per day. This practice increases the risk that errors and vulnerabilities are present in the software code underlying\nour platform. The third-party software that we incorporate into our platform may also be subject to errors or vulnerability. Any errors or vulnerabilities\ndiscovered in our code or from third-party software after release could result in negative publicity, a loss of users or loss of revenue and access or other\nperformance issues. Such vulnerabilities could also be exploited by malicious actors and result in exposure of data of users on our platform, or otherwise result\nin a security breach or incident. We may need to expend significant financial and development resources to analyze, correct, eliminate or work around errors or\ndefects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities. Any failure to timely and effectively resolve any such errors, defects or vulnerabilities could adversely affect\nour business, financial condition and results of operations as well as negatively impact our reputation or brand.\nFurther, our systems, or those of third parties upon which we rely, may experience service interruptions or degradation because of hardware and\nsoftware defects or malfunctions, distributed denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, natural disasters,\npower losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware or\nother events. Our systems also may be subject to break-ins, sabotage, theft and intentional acts of vandalism, including by our own employees.

These events have resulted in, and similar future events could result in, losses of\nrevenue or additional costs and expenses. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability, speed or other functionality of our\nofferings could adversely affect our business and reputation and could result in the loss of users.

When we introduced a\npeer-to-peer ridesharing marketplace in 2012, the laws and regulations in place at the time did not directly address our offerings. Laws and regulations that\nwere in existence at that time, and some that have since been adopted, were often applied to our industry and our business in a manner that limited our\nrelationships with drivers or otherwise inhibited the growth of our ridesharing marketplace. We have been proactively working with federal, state and local\ngovernments and regulatory bodies to ensure that our ridesharing marketplace and other offerings are available broadly in the United States and Canada. In part\ndue to our efforts, a large majority of U.S. states have adopted laws related to TNCs to address the unique issues of the ridesharing industry. New laws and\nregulations and changes to existing laws and regulations continue to be adopted, implemented and interpreted in response to our industry and related\ntechnologies. As we expand our business into new markets or introduce new offerings into existing markets, regulatory bodies or courts may claim that we or\nusers on our platform are subject to additional requirements, or that we are prohibited from conducting our business in certain jurisdictions, or that users on our\nplatform are prohibited from using our platform, either generally or with respect to certain offerings. Certain jurisdictions and governmental entities, including\nairports, require us to obtain permits, pay fees or comply with certain reporting and other operational requirements to provide our ridesharing, bike and scooter\nsharing, and Flexdrive offerings. These jurisdictions and governmental entities may reject our applications for permits, revoke or suspend existing or deny\nrenewals of permits to operate, delay our ability to operate, increase their fees, charge new types of fees, or impose fines and penalties, including as a result of\nerrors in, or failures to comply with, reporting or other requirements related to our product offerings. Any of the foregoing actions by these jurisdictions and\ngovernmental entities could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRecent financial, political and other events have increased the level of regulatory scrutiny on larger companies, technology companies in general and\ncompanies engaged in dealings with independent contractors, such as ridesharing and delivery companies.

Further, in 2021, the U.S.\nSecretary of Labor expressed his view that in some cases \u201cgig workers should be classified as employees\u201d and that further review was ongoing. On January 10,\n2024, the U.S. Department of Labor issued a new final rule containing interpretive guidance for the classification of workers as employees or independent\ncontractors, reverting back to a multi-factor \u201ceconomic realities\u201d test to determine if a worker was properly classified under the federal Fair Labor Standards\nAct (\u201cFLSA\u201d). On June 13, 2023, the National Labor Relations Board (\u201cNLRB\u201d) issued a ruling in Atlanta Opera, reverting back to a more expansive federal\ntest for classifying independent contractors under the National Labor Relations Act (\u201cNLRA\u201d), the federal law that governs collective bargaining.

From time to time third parties may assert, and in the past have asserted,\nclaims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us. See the section titled \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d for additional information about these types of legal\nproceedings. In addition, third parties have sent us correspondence regarding various allegations of intellectual property infringement and, in some instances,\nhave sought to initiate licensing discussions. Although we believe that we have meritorious defenses, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in\ndefending against these allegations or reaching a business resolution that is satisfactory to us. Our competitors and others may now and in the future have\nsignificantly larger and more mature patent portfolios than us. In addition, we have faced, and may again in the future face, litigation involving patent holding\ncompanies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product or service revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or\nno deterrence or protection. Many potential litigants, including some of our competitors and patent-holding companies, have the ability to dedicate substantial\nresources to assert their intellectual property rights. Any claim of infringement by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial\ncosts defending against the claim, could distract our management from our business and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, we risk compromising our confidential\ninformation during this type of litigation. We may be required to pay substantial damages, royalties or other fees in connection with a claimant securing a\njudgment against us, we may be subject to an injunction or other restrictions that prevent us from using or distributing our intellectual property, or we may\nagree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing our offerings or a portion thereof, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nWith respect to any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to seek out a license to continue operations found to be in violation of such rights,\nwhich may not be available on favorable or commercially reasonable terms and may significantly increase our operating expenses. Some licenses may be non-\nexclusive, and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If a third-party does not offer us a license to its intellectual\nproperty on reasonable terms, or at all, we may be required to develop alternative, non-infringing technology or other intellectual property, which could require\nsignificant time (during which we would be unable to continue to offer our affected offerings), effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful.

We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, trade secret laws and\ncontractual restrictions to establish and protect our intellectual property. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or\neffective, and may vary by jurisdiction. Even if we do detect violations, we may need to engage in litigation to enforce our rights. Any enforcement efforts we\nundertake, including litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive and could divert management attention. While we take precautions designed to protect\nour intellectual property, it may still be possible for competitors and other unauthorized third parties to copy our technology, reverse engineer our data and use\nour proprietary information to create or enhance competing solutions and services, which could adversely affect our position in our rapidly evolving and highly\ncompetitive industry.

Litigation to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and\ncould result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses,\ncounterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our intellectual property and\nproprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, could\nimpair the functionality of our platform, delay introductions of enhancements to our platform, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into\nour platform or harm our reputation or brand. In addition, we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop and market new\nofferings or platform features, which may not be on commercially reasonable terms or at all and could adversely affect our ability to compete.\nOur industry has also been subject to attempts to steal intellectual property, including by foreign actors. We, along with others in our industry, have\nbeen the target of attempted thefts of our intellectual property and may be subject to such attempts in the future. Although we take measures to protect our\nproperty, if we are unable to prevent the theft of our intellectual property or its exploitation, the value of our investments may be undermined and our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted.\nChanges in laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection or the protection or transfer of personal data, or any actual or perceived failure by us to\ncomply with such laws and regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection or the protection or transfer of personal data, could\nadversely affect our business.\nWe receive, transmit, store and otherwise process a large volume of personal information and other data relating to users on our platform, as well as\nother individuals such as our employees. Numerous local, municipal, state, federal and international laws and regulations address privacy, data protection and\nthe collection, storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of certain data, including the California Online Privacy Protection Act, the Personal Information\nProtection and Electronic Documents Act, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, Canada\u2019s Anti-Spam Law, the\nTelephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, or TCPA, the U.S. Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the\nHITECH Act, or HIPAA, Section 5(c) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, and the California Privacy Rights\nAct, or CPRA, which became operative as of January 1, 2023. The scope of data protection laws may continually change, through new legislation, amendments\nto existing legislation and changes in enforcement, and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. For example, the CPRA requires new disclosures\nto California consumers and affords such consumers new data rights and abilities to opt-out of certain sharing of personal information. The CPRA provides for\nfines of up to $7,500 per violation, which can be applied on a per-consumer basis. Aspects of the CPRA and its interpretation and enforcement remain unclear.\nAdditionally, several states in the U.S., including California and other states where we do business, have enacted legislation relating to privacy and information\nsecurity, and the U.S. federal government and other states are also contemplating federal and state privacy legislation. These new and modified laws, including\nthe CPRA, and other changes in laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, particularly any new or modified laws or\nregulations that require enhanced protection of data or new obligations with regard to data retention, transfer or disclosure, could greatly increase the cost of\nproviding our offerings, require significant changes to our operations and our data processing practices and policies, may require us to incur additional\ncompliance-related costs and expenses, and may even prevent us from providing certain offerings in jurisdictions in which we currently operate and in which\nwe may operate in the future.\nFurther, as we continue to expand our offerings and user base, we may become subject to additional privacy-related laws and regulations.

Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial\nreporting could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause a decline in the market price of our Class\nA common stock.\nChanges in U.S. and foreign tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial conditions.\nWe are subject to tax laws, regulations, and policies of the U.S. federal, state, and local governments and of comparable taxing authorities in foreign\njurisdictions. As various levels of governments and international organizations become increasingly focused on tax reform, changes in tax laws, as well as other\nfactors, could cause us to experience fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rates and otherwise adversely affect our tax positions and/or our tax\nliabilities. For example, the United States passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, which introduced a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks that could impact us\nin connection with a settlement of the capped call transactions. Further, a provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the option to deduct\nresearch and development expenditures in the year incurred and requires the capitalization and amortization of such costs. The Organization for Economic\nCooperation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d) released Pillar Two model rules defining a 15% global minimum tax for large multinational companies. The OECD\ncontinues to release additional guidance and countries are in various stages of implementation with widespread adoption of the Pillar Two Framework expected\nin the near future. Any of these or other developments or changes in tax laws or rulings in jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our effective\ntax rate and our operating results.\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, gross receipts, value added or similar\ntaxes and may successfully impose additional obligations on us, and any such assessments or obligations could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nThe application of indirect taxes, such as payroll tax, sales and use tax, value-added tax, goods and services tax, business tax and gross receipts tax, to\nbusinesses like ours and to drivers is a complex and evolving issue. Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established\nbefore the adoption and growth of the Internet and e-commerce. Significant judgment is required on an ongoing basis to evaluate applicable tax obligations,\nand as a result, amounts recorded are estimates and are subject to adjustments. In many cases, the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear\nhow new and existing statutes might apply to our business or to drivers\u2019 businesses.\nIn addition, local governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenue, which has resulted in discussions about tax reform and other\nlegislative action to increase tax revenue, including through indirect taxes. For example, it is becoming more common for local governments to impose per trip\nfees specifically on TNC rides. Such taxes may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn certain jurisdictions, we collect and remit indirect taxes. However, tax authorities have raised and may continue to raise questions about or\nchallenge or disagree with our calculation, reporting, or collection of taxes, and may require us to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do\nso or to remit additional taxes and interest, and could impose associated penalties and interest. A successful assertion by one or more tax authorities requiring\nus to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so or to collect additional taxes in a jurisdiction in which we currently collect taxes, could\nresult in substantial tax liabilities, including taxes on past transactions, as well as penalties and interest, and could discourage drivers and riders from utilizing\nour offerings or could otherwise harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Although we have reserved for potential payments of\npossible past tax liabilities in our financial statements, if these liabilities exceed such reserves, our financial condition could be harmed.\nAdditionally, one or more states, localities or other taxing jurisdictions may seek to impose additional reporting, record-keeping or indirect tax\ncollection obligations on businesses like ours.

For example, the Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. We are also required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over\nfinancial reporting.

In addition, as a public company, we may be subject to stockholder activism, which can lead to substantial additional costs,\ndistract management and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. As a result of disclosure of information\nin filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition will become more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation,\nincluding by competitors. Furthermore, if any issues in complying with those requirements are identified, we may incur additional costs rectifying those or new\nissues, and the existence of these issues could adversely affect our reputation or investor perceptions of it.\nCertain members of our management team have limited experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with public company investors\nand complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage being a\npublic company subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of securities\nanalysts and investors. These obligations and constituents require significant attention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from\nthe day-to-day management of our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\nWe have established environmental programs, such as requiring our suppliers to ensure the efficient use of raw materials, water, and energy resources\nvia our Supplier Code of Conduct, and we recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. For example, our San\nFrancisco, California headquarters is projected to be vulnerable to future water scarcity and sea level rise due to climate change, as well as climate-related\nevents including wildfires and associated power shut-offs. Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and their\nimpact on critical infrastructure in the U.S. and elsewhere, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-party suppliers, and the business of our\ncustomers, and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. Additionally, we are subject to\nemerging climate change policies such as California\u2019s Clean Miles Standard and Incentive Program and California SB 253 and SB 261, which impose\ngreenhouse gas and EV requirements on our industry, and efforts to meet those requirements as well as failure to do so could have adverse impacts on our costs\nand ability to operate in California, as well as public goodwill towards our company. Massachusetts, New York City and Toronto developed and implemented\nrules to address the environmental impact of rideshare, and other jurisdictions are likely to consider similar rules and regulations in the future.

Furthermore, these EV programs are asset-intensive and require significant capital investments and recurring costs,\nincluding debt payments, maintenance, depreciation, asset life and asset replacement costs, and if we are not able to maintain sufficient levels of utilization of\nsuch assets or such offerings are otherwise not successful, our investments may not generate sufficient returns and our financial condition may be adversely\naffected. If we are not able to allocate sufficient capital or other resources to these programs and achievement of these goals, we may not be able to make\nprogress toward or achieve such commitments and goals in a timely manner or at all, or we may need to modify or terminate certain programs or goals.

Additionally, uncertain and volatile\nmacroeconomic conditions, including economic instability or uncertainty, and other events beyond our control, such as slowing growth in the worldwide\neconomy, inflation and higher interest rates, as well as the instability and volatility in the banking and financial services sector, and the war in Ukraine, have\nnegatively impacted the financing markets, and may impact our access to capital and make additional capital more difficult or available only on terms less\nfavorable to us.

For example, in\nFebruary 2023, we closed the sale of our vehicle service center business and in July 2023, we announced that we are exploring strategic alternatives for our\nLight Vehicles business. In addition, as a result of our acquisition of PBSC, we became an indirect party to certain partnerships and joint ventures that we did\nnot negotiate, and with partners with whom we are less familiar. These types of transactions present certain risks; for example, we may not achieve the desired\nstrategic, operational and financial benefits of a divestiture, partnership, joint venture or other strategic transaction, or we may have difficulty operating\ntogether with another partner or joint venturer. In addition, in light of increased interest rates and the volatility of the financial markets, it may be more difficult\nto find suitable acquirors or business partners, and during the pendency of a divestiture or during the integration or separation process of any strategic\ntransaction, we may be subject to risks related to a decline in the business, loss of employees, customers, or suppliers, and the risk that the transaction does not\nclose.\nFurther, minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal,\noperational, regulatory, and/or compliance risks associated with the investment. In addition, we may be dependent on other persons or entities who control the\nentities in which we invest, including their management or controlling shareholders, and who may have business interests, strategies, or goals that are\ninconsistent with ours. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of the joint venture partners, controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or\nentities who control them may adversely affect the value of our investment or result in litigation or regulatory action against us. We can provide no assurance\nthat our investments in other technologies or businesses will generate returns for our business, or that we will not lose our initial investment in whole or in part.\nFor example, in October 2022, one of our autonomous vehicle partners announced its wind-down, and as a result we incurred a total impairment of $135.7\nmillion consisting of impairments of our non-marketable equity investment in such company and other assets.\nIf we fail to address the foregoing risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future acquisitions of businesses, new technologies,\nservices and other assets, strategic investments or other transactions, or if we fail to successfully integrate such acquisitions or investments, or if we are unable\nto successfully complete other transactions or such transactions do not meet our strategic objectives, our business, results of operations and financial condition\ncould be adversely affected.\nServicing our current and future debt may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our\nindebtedness. Our payment obligations under such indebtedness may limit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our\nflexibility in operating our business or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn May 2020, we issued our 2025 Notes in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers. In addition, in connection with our acquisition of\nFlexdrive, which is an independently managed, wholly-owned subsidiary, Flexdrive remained responsible for its obligations under a Loan and Security\nAgreement, as amended, with a third-party lender, a Master Vehicle Acquisition Financing and Security Agreement, as amended, with a third-party lender and a\nVehicle Procurement Agreement, as amended, with a third-party; and, following the acquisition, we continued to guarantee the payments of Flexdrive for any\namounts borrowed under these agreements. As of December 31, 2023, we had $865.2 million of indebtedness for borrowed money outstanding. In November\n2022, we also entered into a revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d) with certain lenders providing the ability to borrow an aggregate\nprincipal amount of up to $420.0 million, none of which has been drawn as of December 31, 2023, and $59.0 million in letters of credit were issued under the\nRevolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2023.

In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by \u201c5-\npercent shareholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar limitations may apply under state tax laws. Our ability to use\nnet operating losses to reduce future taxable income and liabilities may be subject to annual limitations as a result of prior ownership changes and ownership\nchanges that may occur in the future.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, as modified by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (\u201cCARES\u201d) Act, among other\nthings, limited the use of NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 to 80% of taxable income for tax years beginning after December 31,\n2020. Not all states conform to the Tax Act or CARES Act. In future years, if and when a net deferred tax asset is recognized related to our NOLs, these\nchanges may significantly impact our valuation allowance assessments for NOLs generated after December 31, 2017.\nRisks Related to Governance and Ownership of our Capital Stock Factors\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting power with our Co-Founders, which will limit your ability to influence\nthe outcome of important transactions, including a change in control.\nOur Class B common stock has 20 votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Our Co-Founders together hold all of the\nissued and outstanding shares of our Class B common stock. Accordingly, Logan Green, our co-founder and Chair of our board of directors holds\napproximately 19.39% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock; and John Zimmer, our co-founder and Vice Chair of our board of directors, holds\napproximately 11.28% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Therefore, our Co-Founders, individually or together, may be able to significantly\ninfluence matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents and any merger,\nconsolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets or other major corporate transactions. Our Co-Founders, individually or together, may have interests\nthat differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated control may have the\neffect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their\ncapital stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our Class A common stock. Each Co-Founder\u2019s voting power is as\nof December 31, 2023 and includes shares of Class A common stock expected to be issued upon the vesting of such Co-Founder\u2019s RSUs within 60 days of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nFuture transfers by the holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting into shares of Class A common stock, subject\nto limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning purposes. In addition, each share of Class B common stock will convert\nautomatically into one share of Class A common stock upon (i) the date specified by affirmative written election of the holders of two-thirds of the then-\noutstanding shares of Class B common stock, (ii) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days following the\ndate on which the shares of Class B common stock held by our Co-Founders and their permitted entities and permitted transferees represent less than 20% of\nthe Class B common stock held by our Co-Founders and their permitted entities as of immediately following the completion of our initial public offering, or\nIPO, or (iii) nine months after the death or total disability of the last to die or become disabled of our Co-Founders, or such later date not to exceed a total\nperiod of 18 months after such death or disability as may be approved by a majority of our independent directors.\nWe cannot predict the impact our dual class structure may have on our stock price.\nWe cannot predict whether our dual class structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our Class A common stock or in adverse\npublicity or other adverse consequences.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4653, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "70e002e2-e65f-4eb1-94a7-8814b96fe9c7": {"__data__": {"id_": "70e002e2-e65f-4eb1-94a7-8814b96fe9c7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "071d22e5-2421-4eea-9faa-546be2497a3e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "c9889cd26e04eba70d3596f7dbc7d3884447873bde14a4549d0dac6346d4b5ab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "58c924e1-0d04-4c87-9dcd-d943d018b8ef", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "1ac873b1ed8a309e8ba1a3d4cb16405abb068bbdb73dffe6b8443ed606beff39", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We cannot predict the impact our dual class structure may have on our stock price.\nWe cannot predict whether our dual class structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our Class A common stock or in adverse\npublicity or other adverse consequences.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are\nbeyond our control.

These risk assessments include identification of reasonably foreseeable internal and external risks, the likelihood and potential damage\nthat could result from such risks, and the sufficiency of existing policies, procedures, systems, and safeguards in place to manage such risks.\n51", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4122, "end_char_idx": 5335, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9b778bea-f1fe-47eb-a95f-4cd24df66f64": {"__data__": {"id_": "9b778bea-f1fe-47eb-a95f-4cd24df66f64", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "73e09a50-e7ab-4643-8de0-8281fc24421f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "9d14e745eeef61dee19f5b1600dbc60c4c18f80cba1ecdd99e50f8354d6632ac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Following these risk assessments, we may accept identified risks; re-design, implement, and maintain reasonable safeguards to minimize identified\nrisks; reasonably address any identified gaps in existing safeguards; and regularly monitor the effectiveness of our safeguards.

We have experienced volatility in the health of our overall\nmarketplace, including fluctuations in driver supply and service levels. Although there has been an improvement in our overall marketplace health, demand for\nour platform has not returned to pre-pandemic levels in all markets and the timing of demand increases have not always aligned with supply availability. Our\npricing adjustments throughout 2023 have helped stimulate demand for our network and increased total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 when\ncompared to the prior year. While these actions may have had an adverse impact on revenue growth and our overall profitability, we believe these changes will\nhave a positive impact on our business over time.\nFor more information on risks associated with these factors, see the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\nRecent Developments(1)\n(1)\n(1)(2)\n55", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3832, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5c107c9-61cb-426e-a4f0-54755be0aa45": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5c107c9-61cb-426e-a4f0-54755be0aa45", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "56", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1050942d-6c09-46b9-8e69-76b846b53928", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "56", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "5468e25a8b3626338ef650bad27f1d41cad3c72618ad5e64b9f93ca9f885a166", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bc93efc8-7680-4860-9250-028fa6070504", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "194980bc483999cf3dc004917714c3878559f76c55a422eb501140ea37586aa6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Revolving Credit Agreement\nOn December 12, 2023, we entered into an amendment to Revolving Credit Facility, which amends the existing agreement to, among other things: (i)\npermit us to refinance existing junior indebtedness (including our convertible senior notes due 2025) with proceeds from one or more new convertible debt\nissuance(s) or other subordinated indebtedness, subject to certain conditions set forth therein, (ii) permit us to repurchase up to $450.0 million of our\nconvertible senior notes due 2025, (iii) extend the applicability of the existing liquidity covenant to the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2024 and (iv) commence\nthe date of the stepdown of the total leverage ratio from 3.50x to 3.00x at the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2025.

Gross Bookings also includes amounts invoiced for other offerings, including but not limited to: Express Drive vehicle rentals, bike and scooter\nrentals, and amounts recognized for subscriptions, bike and bike station hardware and software sales, media, sponsorships, partnerships, and licensing and data\naccess agreements. Adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings) is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA for a period by Gross\nBookings for the same period. For the definition of Adjusted EBITDA, refer to \u201cNon-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d.\nThe increase in Gross Bookings in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 was due primarily to Rides\ngrowth which benefited from improvements in marketplace health driven by our competitive pricing adjustments in addition to our focused execution.\n56", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3442, "end_char_idx": 5644, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f9b0bbf4-df5b-4e4b-9c60-0fba3ac1a5e3": {"__data__": {"id_": "f9b0bbf4-df5b-4e4b-9c60-0fba3ac1a5e3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "13923ccf-5aa2-4994-bec1-a87efc9eacf3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "71a1ac7d71493ada5137a3d0dbcfb1c7c71d23b77ac7af408841b5a2702c088b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The improvements in net loss as a percentage of Gross Bookings and Adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings) in the\nyear ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 were due primarily to our cost-restructuring efforts in the first half of the\nyear which helped us to partially offset the impact of competitive pricing to net loss and Adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, our net loss in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 included a $135.7 million impairment charge related to a non-marketable equity investment in a privately held company and other assets\nwhich negatively impacted net loss as a percentage of Gross Bookings in the year ended December 31, 2022, but did not have a similar impact in 2023.\nRides\nRides represent the level of usage of our multimodal platform.\nWe define Rides as the total number of rides including rideshare and bike and scooter rides completed using our multimodal platform that contribute\nto our revenue. These include any Rides taken through our Lyft App. If multiple riders take a private rideshare ride, including situations where one party picks\nup another party on the way to a destination, or splits the bill, we count this as a single rideshare ride. Each unique segment of a Shared Ride is considered a\nsingle Ride. For example, if two riders successfully match in Shared Ride mode and both complete their Rides, we count this as two Rides. We have largely\nshifted away from Shared Rides, and now only offer Shared Rides in limited markets. We include all Rides taken by riders via our Concierge offering, even\nthough such riders may be excluded from the definition of Active Riders unless the ride is accessible in that rider\u2019s Lyft App.\nThe increase in Rides in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 was due primarily to our improved\nmarketplace heath and competitive pricing adjustments, which also resulted in Active Riders reaching a multi-year high.\nActive Riders\nThe number of Active Riders is a key indicator of the scale of our user community.\nActive Riders\n2023 2022\n(in millions)\nThree Months Ended March 31 19.6 17.8\nThree Months Ended June 30 21.5 19.9\nThree Months Ended September 30 22.4 20.3\nThree Months Ended December 31 22.4 20.4\nWe define Active Riders as all riders who take at least one ride during a quarter where the Lyft Platform processes the transaction. An Active Rider is\nidentified by a unique phone number. If a rider has two mobile phone numbers or changed their phone number and that rider took rides using both phone\nnumbers during the quarter, that person would count as two Active Riders. If a rider has a personal and business profile tied to the same mobile phone number,\nthat person would be considered a single Active Rider. If a ride has been requested by an organization using our Concierge offering for the benefit of a rider, we\nexclude this rider in the calculation of Active Riders unless the ride is accessible in that rider\u2019s Lyft App.\nIn each of the three month periods ended March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2023, Active Riders increased compared to the same\nperiods in 2022 primarily due to an increase in demand driven by competitive pricing adjustments which resulted in Active Riders in the fourth quarter of 2023\nbeing just shy of our all-time high.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are prepared in accordance\nwith GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe\nto be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our\nestimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected.\nWe believe that the accounting policies described below involve a significant degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, we believe these are\nthe most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

We recognize revenue from fees paid by\ndrivers for use of our Lyft Platform offerings in accordance with ASC 606 as described in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Drivers\nenter into terms of service (\u201cToS\u201d) with us in order to use our Lyft Driver App.\nWe provide a service to drivers to complete a successful transportation service for riders. This service includes on-demand lead generation that assists\ndrivers to find, receive and fulfill on-demand requests from riders seeking transportation services and related collection activities using our Lyft Platform. As a\nresult, our single performance obligation in the transaction is to connect drivers with riders to facilitate the completion of a successful transportation service for\nriders.\nWe evaluate the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we act as a principal by controlling the transportation service\nprovided to the rider or whether we act as an agent by arranging for third parties to provide the service to the rider. We facilitate the provision of a\ntransportation service by a driver to a rider (the driver\u2019s customer) in order for the driver to fulfill their contractual promise to the rider. The driver fulfills their\npromise to provide a transportation service to their customer through use of the Lyft Platform. While we facilitate setting the price for transportation services,\nthe drivers and riders have the discretion in accepting the transaction price through the platform. We do not control the transportation services being provided to\nthe rider nor do we have inventory risk related to the transportation services. As a result, we act as an agent in facilitating the ability for a driver to provide a\ntransportation service to a rider.\nWe report revenue on a net basis, reflecting the service fees and commissions owed to us from the drivers as revenue, and not the gross amount\ncollected from the rider. We made this determination of not being primarily responsible for the services since we do not promise the transportation services, do\nnot contract with drivers to provide transportation services on our behalf, do not control whether the driver accepts or declines the transportation request via the\nLyft Platform, and do not control the provision of transportation services by drivers to riders at any point in time either before, during, or after, the trip.\nWe consider the ToS and our customary business practices in identifying the contracts under ASC 606. As our customary business practice, a contract\nexists between the driver and us when the driver\u2019s ability to cancel the trip lapses, which typically is upon pickup of the rider. We collect the fare and related\ncharges from riders on behalf of drivers using the rider\u2019s pre-authorized credit card or other payment mechanism and retain any fees owed to us before making\nthe remaining disbursement to drivers; thus the driver\u2019s ability and intent to pay is not subject to significant judgment.\nWe earn service fees and commissions from the drivers either as the difference between an amount paid by a rider based on an upfront quoted fare and\nthe amount earned by a driver based on actual time and distance for the trip or as a fixed percentage of the fare charged to the rider. In an upfront quoted fare\narrangement, as we do not control the driver\u2019s actions at any point in the transaction to limit the time and distance for the trip, we take on risks related to the\ndriver\u2019s actions which may not be fully mitigated. We earn a variable amount from the drivers and may record a loss from a transaction, which is recorded as a\nreduction to revenue, in instances where an up-front quoted fare offered to a rider is less than the amount we are committed to pay the driver.\nWe recognize revenue upon completion of a ride as the single performance obligation is satisfied and we have the right to receive payment for the\nservices rendered upon the completion of the ride.\nWe offer various incentive programs to drivers that are recorded as reduction to revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service in consideration\nor if we cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of goods or services received.\nIn some cases, we also earn Concierge platform fees from organizations that use our Concierge offering, which is a product that allows organizations\nto request rides for their customers and employees through our ridesharing marketplace. Concierge platform fees are earned as a fixed dollar amount per ride or\na percentage of the ride price depending on the contract and such Concierge platform fee revenue is recognized on a gross basis.\nWe recognize revenue from subscription fees paid by users to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform and mobile-based applications\nover the applicable subscription period.\nWe also recognize revenue from bikes and bike station hardware and software sales when control is transferred to the customer.

These arrangements\ngenerally require us to provide advertising services over a fixed period of time for which revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual period. These\nrevenues are not significant to the Company\u2019s consolidated revenue.\nRental Revenue (ASC 842)\nWe generate rental revenues primarily from Flexdrive and our network of Light Vehicles. Under the Flexdrive program, we operate a fleet of rental\nvehicles comprised of both vehicles owned by us and vehicles leased from third-party leasing companies. We either lease or sublease vehicles to drivers and as\na result, we are considered the accounting lessor or sublessor, as applicable, in these arrangements in accordance with ASC 842. For vehicles that are subleased,\nsublease income and head lease expense for these transactions are recognized on a gross basis on the consolidated financial statements. Drivers who rent\nvehicles are charged rental fees, which we collect from the driver by deducting such amounts from the driver\u2019s earnings on the Lyft Platform.\nRevenue generated from single-use ride fees paid by Light Vehicles riders are recognized upon completion of each related ride. Revenue generated\nfrom Flexdrive is recognized evenly over the rental period, which is typically seven days or less. Due to the short-term nature of the Flexdrive and Light\nVehicle transactions, we classify these rentals as operating leases.\nInsurance Reserves and Insurance-related Accruals\nWe utilize both a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and third-party insurance, which may include deductibles and self-insured retentions, to\ninsure or reinsure costs including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal\ninjury protection under state law and general business liabilities up to certain limits. The recorded liabilities reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but\nnot paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these\noutstanding claim payments. Liabilities are determined on a quarterly basis by internal actuaries through an analysis of historical trends, changes in claims\nexperience including consideration of new information and application of loss development factors for the insurance reserves and frequency and severity\nassumptions for the insurance-related accruals, among other inputs and assumptions. On an annual basis, an independent third-party actuary will evaluate the\nliabilities for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations.\nInsurance claims may take years to completely settle, and we have limited historical loss experience. Because of the limited operational history, we\nmake certain assumptions based on currently available information and industry statistics, with the loss development factors as the most significant\nassumptions related to the insurance reserves and the frequency and severity assumptions as the most significant assumptions related to insurance-related\naccruals, and utilize actuarial models and techniques to estimate the reserves. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of\ntime the claim remains open, economic and healthcare cost trends and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for\nevents that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections. The impact of these factors on ultimate costs for insurance is\ndifficult to estimate and could be material. However, while we believe that the insurance reserve and insurance-related accrual amounts are adequate, the\nultimate liabilities may be in excess of, or less than, the amounts provided. As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liabilities and\nwhen amounts will be paid may significantly vary from the estimated amounts provided for in the consolidated balance sheets. We continue to review our\ninsurance reserve estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical experience develops, additional claims are reported as settled, and the legal, regulatory\nand economic environment evolves.\nOn April 22, 2021, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Pacific Valley Insurance Company, Inc. (\u201cPVIC\u201d), entered into a Quota Share Reinsurance\nAgreement (the \u201cReinsurance Agreement\u201d) with DARAG Bermuda LTD (\u201cDARAG\u201d), under which DARAG reinsured a legacy portfolio of auto insurance\npolicies, based on reserves in place as of March 31, 2021, for $183.2 million of coverage above the liabilities recorded as of that date. Under the terms of the\nReinsurance Agreement, PVIC ceded to DARAG approximately $251.3 million of certain legacy insurance liabilities for policies underwritten during the\nperiod of October 1, 2018 to October 1, 2020, with an aggregate limit of $434.5 million, for a premium of $271.5 million (the \u201cReinsurance Transaction\u201d).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5062, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8b826b26-4105-4f64-8342-966ab653c6fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "8b826b26-4105-4f64-8342-966ab653c6fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a22dec0e-f5c7-4b8f-bc25-87cc9c23b7e4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "ffb992ca2b6fa22804f6dcd3e853d6b3e40e0d9c1ecdfa77a3e732f6efff4877", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c0f20e52-b812-4647-a41e-1347f9d83c8b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "60c86944063e125f9126d8508dd8a99ee5832c2a18859ce40fa3eff709ecb932", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "On April 22, 2021, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Pacific Valley Insurance Company, Inc. (\u201cPVIC\u201d), entered into a Quota Share Reinsurance\nAgreement (the \u201cReinsurance Agreement\u201d) with DARAG Bermuda LTD (\u201cDARAG\u201d), under which DARAG reinsured a legacy portfolio of auto insurance\npolicies, based on reserves in place as of March 31, 2021, for $183.2 million of coverage above the liabilities recorded as of that date. Under the terms of the\nReinsurance Agreement, PVIC ceded to DARAG approximately $251.3 million of certain legacy insurance liabilities for policies underwritten during the\nperiod of October 1, 2018 to October 1, 2020, with an aggregate limit of $434.5 million, for a premium of $271.5 million (the \u201cReinsurance Transaction\u201d).\nLosses ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement that exceed $271.5 million, but are below the aggregate limit of $434.5 million, result in the recognition of a\ndeferred gain liability. The deferred gain liability is amortized and recognized as a benefit to the statement of operations over the estimated remaining\nsettlement period of the ceded reserves. The settlement period of the ceded reserves is based on the life-to-date cumulative losses collected and likely extends\nover periods longer than a quarter. The amount of the deferral that is amortized was recalculated each period based on loss payments and updated estimates of\nthe portfolio\u2019s total losses. When the amount and timing of the reinsurance recoveries are uncertain, the recovery method should be used to calculate the\namount of amortization in period. The deferral of gains had a negative impact in respective period to cost of revenue as the losses on direct liabilities were not\noffset by gains from excess benefits under the Reinsurance Agreement. The amortization of these deferred gains provided a benefit to cost of revenue over\nperiods equal to the excess benefits received.\nOn June 21, 2022, PVIC and DARAG completed the Commutation Transaction, which effectively commuted and settled the Reinsurance Agreement.\nAs a result of the Commutation Transaction, the Company recognized a $36.8 million gain in cost of revenue in the three months ended June 30, 2022,\nincluding amortization of a portion of the previously recognized deferred gain.

Refer to Note 6 \u201cSupplemental Financial Statement Information\u201d to the consolidated financial statements\nfor information regarding these transactions.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe incur stock-based compensation expense primarily from RSUs, performance based stock units (\u201cPSUs\u201d) and stock purchase rights granted under\nour Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201cESPP\u201d).\nWe estimate the fair value of ESPP purchase rights using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We recognize compensation expense related to the\nESPP purchase rights on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is typically 12 months.\nThe fair value of RSUs and PSUs are estimated based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, which is based on the closing\nprice of our Class A common stock as reported on the date of grant.\nCompensation expense for RSUs is generally recognized based on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Stock-based compensation\nexpense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and reflects estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary,\nin subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates. As of December 31, 2023, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to all\nunvested awards was $203.1 million, which we expect to recognize over the remaining weighted-average period of approximately 1.2 years.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, allocation of the fair value\nof purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess\nof the fair value of purchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair value of\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value\nare based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from\nestimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new information is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. After\nthe measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected on the consolidated statements of operations. Acquisition costs, such as legal and consulting\nfees, are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business\ncombination. Intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of entities accounted for using the purchase method of accounting are estimated by us based on the\nfair value of assets received. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives which range from two to twelve years.\nGoodwill is not subject to amortization, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. As part of the annual goodwill impairment test, we first perform a\nqualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. If, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more-likely-than-not that\nthe fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amounts, the quantitative impairment test will be required. There was no impairment of goodwill\nrecorded for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for recently issued accounting\npronouncements not yet adopted as of the date of this report. \nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nRevenue consists of revenue recognized from fees paid by drivers for use of our Lyft Platform offerings, Concierge platform fees from organizations\nthat use our Concierge offering, subscription fees paid by riders to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform, revenue from bikes and bike station\nhardware and software sales, revenue from licensing and data access agreements and revenue from arrangements to provide advertising services to third parties\nthat are interested in reaching users of our platform.

Insurance costs consist of insurance generally required under TNC and city regulations\nfor ridesharing and bike and scooter rentals and also includes occupational hazard insurance for drivers in California. Payment processing charges include\nmerchant fees, chargebacks and failed charges. Other costs included in cost of revenue are hosting and platform-related technology costs, personnel-related\ncompensation costs, depreciation, amortization of technology-related intangible assets, asset write-off charges and costs related to Flexdrive, which include\nvehicle lease expenses and remarketing gains and losses related to the sale of vehicles.

Light Vehicle fleet operations support costs include general repairs and\nmaintenance, and other customer support activities related to repositioning bikes and scooters for rider convenience, cleaning and safety checks.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs and facilities costs. Such expenses include costs related\nto autonomous vehicle technology initiatives. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nOn July 13, 2021, we completed a transaction with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation, for the divestiture of certain assets\nrelated to our self-driving vehicle division, Level 5, and as a result, certain costs related to our prior initiative to develop self-driving systems were eliminated\nbeginning in the third quarter of 2021.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of rider incentives, personnel-related compensation costs, driver incentives for referring new drivers or\nriders, advertising expenses, rider refunds and marketing partnerships with third parties. Sales and marketing costs are expensed as incurred.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs, professional services fees, certain insurance costs that\nare generally not required under TNC regulations, certain loss contingency expenses including legal accruals and settlements, insurance claims administrative\nfees, policy spend, depreciation, facility costs and other corporate costs.

Interest expense also includes interest incurred on our Non-Revolving Loan and our Master Vehicle Loan.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of an impairment charge related to a non-marketable equity investment and other assets in 2022, a pre-\ntax gain as a result of the transaction with Woven Planet in 2021, interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents, sublease income and restricted and\nunrestricted short-term investments.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur provision for income taxes consists of federal and state taxes in the U.S. and foreign taxes in jurisdictions in which we conduct business. As we\nexpand the scale of our international business activities, any changes in the U.S. and foreign taxation of such activities may increase our overall provision for\nincome taxes in the future.\nWe have a valuation allowance for our U.S. deferred tax assets, including federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs. We expect to\nmaintain this valuation allowance until it becomes more likely than not that the benefit of our federal and state deferred tax assets will be realized.\n61", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4732, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c250f1c1-5a23-4fc6-b2fe-29aa888ac201": {"__data__": {"id_": "c250f1c1-5a23-4fc6-b2fe-29aa888ac201", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2240d8c5-367a-49d4-b74b-5a20b9e9155a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "43e7b9a4c31e25c3668bdac266115344ab4385abdcddd5ce17ea7745f7734dde", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Results of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our historical consolidated statements of operations data:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in thousands)\nRevenue $ 4,403,589 $ 4,095,135 $ 3,208,323 \nCosts and expenses\nCost of revenue 2,543,954 2,435,736 1,702,317 \nOperations and support 427,239 443,846 402,233 \nResearch and development 555,916 856,777 911,946 \nSales and marketing 481,004 531,512 411,406 \nGeneral and administrative 871,080 1,286,180 915,638 \nTotal costs and expenses 4,879,193 5,554,051 4,343,540 \nLoss from operations (475,604) (1,458,916) (1,135,217)\nInterest expense (26,223) (19,735) (51,635)\nOther income (expense), net 170,123 (99,988) 135,933 \nLoss before income taxes (331,704) (1,578,639) (1,050,919)\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes 8,616 5,872 11,225 \nNet loss $ (340,320)$ (1,584,511)$ (1,062,144)\nThe following table sets forth the components of our consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of revenue:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nRevenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %\nCosts and expenses\nCost of revenue 57.8 59.5 53.1 \nOperations and support 9.7 10.8 12.5 \nResearch and development 12.6 20.9 28.4 \nSales and marketing 10.9 13.0 12.8 \nGeneral and administrative 19.8 31.4 28.5 \nTotal costs and expenses 110.8 135.6 135.4 \nLoss from operations (10.8) (35.6) (35.4)\nInterest expense (0.6) (0.5) (1.6)\nOther income (expense), net 3.9 (2.4) 4.2 \nLoss before income taxes (7.5) (38.5) (32.8)\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes 0.2 0.1 0.3 \nNet loss (7.7)% (38.7)% (33.1)%\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nRevenue\nYear Ended December 31,2023 to 2022\n% change2022 to 2021 %\nChange 2023 2022 2021\n(in thousands, except for percentages)\nRevenue $ 4,403,589 $ 4,095,135 $ 3,208,323 8 % 28 %\nRevenue increased $308.5 million, or 8%, in 2023 as compared to the prior year, due primarily to growth in demand along with our improved\nmarketplace health and competitive pricing adjustments initiated in early 2023.

During the first quarter of\n2020, we entered into a Novation Agreement for the transfer of certain legacy auto insurance liabilities between October 1, 2015 and September 30, 2018.\nRefer to Note 6 \u201cSupplemental Financial Statement Information\u201d to the consolidated financial statements regarding these transactions. We believed the costs\nassociated with these transactions related to certain legacy auto insurance liabilities did not illustrate the current period performance of our ongoing operations\nat the time despite this transaction occurring in the current period because the impacted insurance liabilities related to claims that date back years. We believe\nthe adjustment to exclude these costs associated with transactions related to legacy insurance liabilities from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income\n(Loss) is useful to investors by enabling them to better assess our operating performance in the context of current period results and provide for better\ncomparability with our historically disclosed Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) amounts.\nLosses ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement that exceeded $271.5 million, but were below the aggregate limit of $434.5 million, resulted in the\nrecognition of a deferred gain liability. The deferral of gains had a negative impact in the respective period to cost of revenue as the losses on direct liabilities\nwere not offset by gains from excess benefits under the Reinsurance Agreement. The amortization of these deferred gains provided a benefit to the cost of\nrevenue over multiple periods equal to the excess benefits received. We believe that the net amount recognized on the statement of operations associated with\nclaims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement, including any related reserve adjustments and any benefit recognized for the related deferred gains, should be\nexcluded to show the ultimate economic benefit of the Reinsurance Agreement. This adjustment helped investors understand the economic benefit of our\nReinsurance Agreement on future trends in our operations, as they improved over the settlement period of any deferred gains. Therefore, in the event that the\nnet amount of any reserve adjustments and any benefits from deferred gains related to claims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement was recognized on the\nstatement of operations, those amounts would be excluded from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) through the exclusion of\nthe \u201cNet amount from claims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement\u201d. As of December 31, 2023, there were no deferred gains related to losses ceded under\nthe Reinsurance Agreement. As of December 31, 2022, we had $2.4 million of deferred gain related to losses ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement which\nwas included within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nDuring the second quarter of 2022, we completed the Commutation Transaction, which effectively commuted and settled the Reinsurance Agreement.\nThe Commutation Transaction resulted in a $36.8 million gain recorded to cost of revenue on the consolidated statement of operations. Refer to Note 6\n\u201cSupplemental Financial Statement Information\u201d to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding these transactions. We believe the\nadjustment to exclude this gain associated with the commutation of the Reinsurance Agreement from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is\nuseful to investors by enabling them to better assess our operating performance in the context of current period results and provide for better comparability with\nour historically disclosed Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) amounts.

Free cash flow does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a\nmeasure of our ability to fund our cash needs. For more information regarding the limitations of free cash flow and a reconciliation of net cash provided by\n(used in) operating activities to free cash flow, see the section titled \u201cReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the\npreparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board\nof directors concerning our financial performance. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be\nlimited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Furthermore, these measures have certain limitations in that they do not include\nthe impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations that are necessary to run our business.

Further, we may in the future enter into\narrangements to acquire or invest in businesses, products, services and technologies.

We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.

Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control\nover financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our\nopinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate\nopinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nValuation of Insurance Reserves and Insurance-Related Accruals\nAs described in Notes 2 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company utilizes both a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and third-party\ninsurance, which may include deductibles and self-insured retentions, to insure or reinsure costs, including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist,\nauto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protection under state law and general business liabilities up to certain limits. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, insurance reserves and insurance-related accruals totaled $1,338 million and $643 million, respectively. These liabilities are determined on\na quarterly basis by internal actuaries through an analysis of historical trends and changes in claims experience. Management makes certain assumptions based\non currently available information and industry statistics, with the loss development factors as the most significant assumption related to the insurance reserves\nand the frequency and severity assumptions as the most significant assumptions related to the insurance-related accruals, and utilizes actuarial models and\ntechniques to estimate the reserves.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves and insurance-related accruals is a\ncritical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when determining the estimated insurance reserves and insurance-related accruals; (ii) a\nhigh degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the actuarial valuation techniques\nand management\u2019s significant assumptions related to loss development factors for the insurance reserves and the frequency and severity for the insurance-\nrelated accruals; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of insurance reserves and insurance-related\naccruals, including the controls over the development of the actuarial valuation techniques and the assumptions related to loss development factors for the\ninsurance reserves and the frequency and severity for the insurance-related accruals. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing the completeness\nand accuracy of historical data provided by management and (ii) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating\nthe reasonableness of management\u2019s estimates by (a) developing independent estimates of certain insurance reserves and insurance-related accruals and\ncomparing these independent estimates to management\u2019s actuarially determined reserves; (b) evaluating the appropriateness of management\u2019s actuarial\ntechniques; (c) evaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s significant assumptions by independently developing loss development factors for the insurance\nreserves and the frequency and severity for the insurance-related accruals based on loss reporting and payment experience and historical trends; and (d)\nevaluating the consistency of management\u2019s actuarial techniques period-over-period.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSan

"text": "Lyft, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation\nOrganization and Description of Business\nLyft, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cLyft\u201d) is incorporated in Delaware with its headquarters in San Francisco, California. The Company operates\nmultimodal transportation networks in the United States and Canada that offer access to a variety of transportation options through the Company\u2019s platform and\nmobile-based applications. This network enables multiple modes of transportation including the facilitation of peer-to-peer ridesharing by connecting drivers\nwho have a vehicle with riders who need a ride. The Lyft Platform provides a marketplace where drivers can be matched with riders via the Lyft App where the\nCompany operates as a transportation network company (\u201cTNC\u201d).\nTransportation options through the Company\u2019s platform and mobile-based applications are substantially comprised of its ridesharing marketplace that\nconnects drivers and riders in cities across the United States and in select cities in Canada, Lyft\u2019s network of bikes and scooters (\u201cLight Vehicles\u201d), and the\nExpress Drive program, where drivers can enter into short-term rental agreements with the Company\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary, Flexdrive Services, LLC\n(\u201cFlexdrive\u201d) or a third party for vehicles that may be used to provide ridesharing services on the Lyft Platform. In addition, the Company makes the\nridesharing marketplace available to organizations through Lyft Business offerings, such as the Concierge and Lyft Pass programs, and generates revenue from\nlicensing and data access agreements associated with the data from the Company's platform, subscription fees, revenue from bikes and bike station hardware\nand software sales and revenue from arrangements to provide advertising services.\nBasis of Presentation\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.\nGAAP) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nThe Company uses the U.S. dollar predominantly as the functional currency of its foreign subsidiaries. For foreign subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar\nis the functional currency, gains and losses from remeasurement of foreign currency balances into U.S. dollars are included on the consolidated statements of\noperations. For the foreign subsidiary where the local currency is the functional currency, translation adjustments of foreign currency financial statements into\nU.S. dollars are recorded to a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported\namounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The Company bases its estimates on various factors and information which may include, but\nare not limited to, history and prior experience, expected future results, new related events and economic conditions, which form the basis for making\njudgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ materially from those\nestimates.\nSignificant items subject to estimates and assumptions include those related to losses resulting from insurance claims inclusive of insurance-related\naccruals, fair value of financial assets and liabilities, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, leases, indirect tax obligations, legal contingencies, valuation\nallowance for deferred income taxes, and the valuation of stock-based compensation.\nSegment Information\nOperating segments are defined as components of an entity for which separate financial information is available and that is regularly reviewed by the\nChief Operating Decision Maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance. The Company\u2019s\nChief Executive Officer is the Company\u2019s CODM. The CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making\noperating decisions, allocating resources, and evaluating financial performance. As such, the Company has determined that it operates as one operating\nsegment. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not generate material international revenues and as of December 31,\n2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not have material assets located outside of the United States.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company generates its revenue from its multimodal transportation networks that offer access to a variety of transportation options through the\nLyft Platform and mobile-based applications. Substantially all, or approximately 85% or more, of the Company\u2019s revenue is generated from its ridesharing\nmarketplace that connects drivers and riders and is recognized in accordance\n83", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5199, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3511347f-84b0-4371-b2c7-38e37dd6e829": {"__data__": {"id_": "3511347f-84b0-4371-b2c7-38e37dd6e829", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8757c934-92ea-4593-89c0-10dfdd60a44b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "ae3222467fe4e79f66afd2b94ffc3d28d476fdff11ff6cf488eebab0a5c90469", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cadfcf53-7bbe-4b29-833f-131de9cdc9d2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "60d0091d966f9677857b3531a91007cf72a4f6b13ed0c1d8f5b439127c55486e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 (\u201cASC 606\u201d). In addition, the Company generates revenue in accordance with ASC 606 from licensing and\ndata access, subscription fees, revenue from bikes and bike station hardware and software sales and revenue from arrangements to provide advertising services\nto third parties, which are not significant components of the Company\u2019s consolidated revenues. The Company also generates rental revenue from Flexdrive and\nits network of Light Vehicles, which is recognized in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842 (\u201cASC 842\u201d).\nThe table below presents the Company's revenues as included on the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nRevenue from contracts with customers (ASC 606) $ 4,116,216 $ 3,811,993 $ 2,957,979 \nRental revenue (ASC 842) 287,373 283,142 250,344 \nTotal revenue $ 4,403,589 $ 4,095,135 $ 3,208,323 \nRevenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606)\nThe Company recognizes revenue for its rideshare marketplace in accordance with ASC 606. The Company generates revenue from service fees and\ncommissions (collectively, \u201cfees\u201d) paid by drivers for use of the Lyft Platform and related activities to connect drivers with riders to facilitate and successfully\ncomplete rides via the Lyft App where the Company operates as a TNC. The Company recognizes revenue upon completion of each ride. Drivers enter into\nterms of service (\u201cToS\u201d) with the Company in order to use the Lyft Driver App. Under the ToS, drivers agree that the Company retains the applicable fee as\nconsideration for their use of the Lyft Platform and related activities from the fare and related charges it collects from riders on behalf of drivers. The Company\nis acting as an agent in facilitating the ability of a driver to provide a transportation service to a rider. The Company reports revenue on a net basis, reflecting\nthe fee owed to the Company from a driver as revenue, and not the gross amount collected from the rider.\nAs the Company\u2019s customary business practice, a contract exists between the driver and the Company when the driver\u2019s ability to cancel the ride\nlapses, which typically is upon pickup of the rider. The Company\u2019s single performance obligation in the transaction is to connect drivers with riders to facilitate\nthe completion of a successful transportation service for riders. The Company recognizes revenue upon completion of a ride as its performance obligation is\nsatisfied upon the completion of the ride. The Company collects the fare and related charges from riders on behalf of drivers using the rider\u2019s pre-authorized\ncredit card or other payment mechanism and retains its fees before making the remaining disbursement to drivers; thus the driver\u2019s ability and intent to pay is\nnot subject to significant judgment.\nThe Company recognizes revenue from subscription fees paid to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform and mobile-based\napplications over the applicable subscription period in accordance with ASC 606. The Company also recognizes revenue from bikes, bike station hardware and\nsoftware sales when control is transferred to the customer in accordance with ASC 606.\nThe Company generates revenue from licensing and data access agreements. The Company is primarily responsible for fulfilling its promise to\nprovide rideshare data and access to Flexdrive vehicles and bears the fulfillment risk, and the responsibility of providing the data, over the license period. The\nCompany is acting as a principal in delivering the data and access licenses and presents revenue on a gross basis. Consideration allocated to each performance\nobligation, the data delivery and vehicle access, is determined by assigning the relative fair value to each of the performance obligations. Revenue is recorded\nupon delivery of the rideshare data and ratably over the quarter for access to fleet vehicles as the Company\u2019s respective performance obligation is satisfied\nupon the delivery of each. These revenues are not material to the Company\u2019s consolidated revenue.\nThe Company has arrangements to provide advertising services to third parties that are interested in reaching users of the Company\u2019s platform. These\narrangements generally require the Company to provide advertising services over a fixed period of time for which revenue is recognized ratably over the\ncontractual period. These revenues are not significant to the Company\u2019s consolidated revenue.\nRental Revenue (ASC 842)\nThe Company generates rental revenues primarily from Flexdrive and its network of Light Vehicles. Rental revenues are recognized for rental and\nrental related activities where an identified asset is transferred to the customer and the customer has the ability to control that asset in accordance with ASC\n842.\nThe Company operates a fleet of rental vehicles through its independently managed subsidiary, Flexdrive, comprised of both owned vehicles and\nvehicles leased from third-party leasing companies.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5029, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cadfcf53-7bbe-4b29-833f-131de9cdc9d2": {"__data__": {"id_": "cadfcf53-7bbe-4b29-833f-131de9cdc9d2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8757c934-92ea-4593-89c0-10dfdd60a44b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "ae3222467fe4e79f66afd2b94ffc3d28d476fdff11ff6cf488eebab0a5c90469", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3511347f-84b0-4371-b2c7-38e37dd6e829", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "6d606908de458465e0dcf52a202de4aeeabdd2a9a27d1d93727699c91b4a8466", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "These revenues are not material to the Company\u2019s consolidated revenue.\nThe Company has arrangements to provide advertising services to third parties that are interested in reaching users of the Company\u2019s platform.

Though the specific terms of\narrangements with cities vary, the Company earns operations fees from cities or shares revenue generated by the systems with cities. Light Vehicle revenue is\naccounted for under ASC 842 for single-use rides. A single-use ride allows the user to select a specific Light Vehicle at the time the arrangement is entered into\nand provides the user the right to control the selected Light Vehicle for the desired term of the arrangement.\nDue to the short-term nature of the Flexdrive and Light Vehicle transactions, the Company classifies these rentals as operating leases. Revenue\ngenerated from single-use ride fees paid by Light Vehicle riders is recognized upon completion of each related ride. Revenue generated from Flexdrive is\nrecognized evenly over the rental period, which is typically seven days or less.\nEnterprise and Trade Receivables\nThe Company collects any fees owed for completed transactions on the Lyft Platform primarily from the rider\u2019s authorized payment method.\nUncollected fees are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets and represent receivables from (i) participants in\nthe Company\u2019s enterprise programs (\u201cEnterprise Users\u201d), where the transactions have been completed and the amounts owed from the Enterprise Users have\neither been invoiced or are unbilled as of the reporting date; and (ii) riders where the authorized payment method is a credit card but the fare amounts have not\nyet settled with third-party payment processors. Under the ToS, drivers agree that the Company retains the applicable fee as consideration for their use of the\nLyft Platform and related activities from the fare and related charges it collects from riders on behalf of drivers. Accordingly, the Company has no trade\nreceivables from drivers. The portion of the fare receivable to be remitted to drivers is included in accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated\nbalance sheets.\nThe Company records an allowance for credit losses for fees owed for completed transactions that may never settle or be collected in accordance with\nAccounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 \u201cFinancial Instruments\u2014Credit Losses\u201d. The allowance for credit losses reflects the Company\u2019s current estimate of\nexpected credit losses inherent in the enterprise and trade receivables balance. In determining the expected credit losses, the Company considers its historical\nloss experience, the aging of its receivable balance, current economic and business conditions, and anticipated future economic events that may impact\ncollectability. The Company reviews its allowance for credit losses periodically and as needed, and amounts are written off when determined to be\nuncollectible.\nThe Company\u2019s receivable balance, which consists primarily of amounts due from Enterprise Users and Light Vehicle partners, was $315.0 million,\n$278.9 million and $196.2 million as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe following table provides a rollforward of the Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses for the periods presented (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nBalance at beginning of period $ 11.6 $ 9.3 $ 15.2 \nChanges to provision (0.4) 1.9 (4.5)\nWrite-offs and recoveries (1.4) 0.4 (1.4)\nBalance at end of period $ 9.8 $ 11.6 $ 9.3 \nIncentive Programs\nThe Company offers incentives to attract drivers, riders and Light Vehicle riders to use the Lyft Platform. Drivers generally receive cash incentives\nwhile riders and Light Vehicle riders generally receive free or discounted rides under such incentive programs. Incentives provided to drivers and Light Vehicle\nriders, the customers of the Company, are accounted for as a reduction of the transaction price. As the riders are not the Company\u2019s customers, incentives\nprovided to riders are generally recognized as sales and marketing expense except for certain pricing programs described below.\nDriver Incentives\nThe Company offers various incentive programs to drivers, including minimum guaranteed payments, volume-based discounts and performance-based\nbonus payments. These driver incentives are similar to retrospective volume-based rebates and represent variable consideration that is typically settled within a\nweek. The Company reduces the transaction price by the estimated amount of the incentives expected to be paid upon completion of the performance criteria\nby applying the most likely outcome method. Therefore, such driver incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue.

Generally, the\nrider incentive programs are as follows:\n(i) Market-wide marketing promotions. Market-wide promotions reduce the fare charged by drivers to riders for all or substantially all rides in a\nspecific market. This type of incentive effectively reduces the overall pricing of the service provided by drivers for that specific market and the\ngross fare charged by the driver to the rider, and thereby results in a lower fee earned by the Company. Accordingly, the Company records this\ntype of incentive as a reduction to revenue at the date it records the corresponding revenue transaction.\n(ii)Targeted marketing promotions. Targeted marketing promotions are used to promote the use of the Lyft Platform to a targeted group of riders. An\nexample is a promotion where the Company offers a number of discounted rides (capped at a given number of rides) which are valid only during\na limited period of time to a targeted group of riders. The Company believes that the incentives that provide consideration to riders to be applied\nto a limited number of rides are similar to marketing coupons. These incentives differ from the market-wide marketing promotions because they\ndo not reduce the overall pricing of the service provided by drivers for a specific market. During the promotion period, riders not utilizing an\nincentive would be charged the full fare. These incentives represent marketing costs. When a rider redeems the incentive, the Company\nrecognizes revenue equal to the transaction price and the cost of the incentive is recorded as sales and marketing expense.\n(iii)Rider referral programs. Under the rider referral program, the referring rider (the referrer) earns referral coupons when a new rider (the referee)\ncompletes their first ride on the Lyft Platform. The Company records the incentive as a liability at the time the incentive is earned by the referrer\nwith the corresponding charge recorded to sales and marketing expense. Referral coupons typically expire within one year. The Company\nestimates breakage using its historical experience. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the rider referral coupon liability was not material.\nLight Vehicle Rider Incentives\nIncentives offered to Light Vehicle riders were not material for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, in relation to the driver, rider and Light Vehicle riders incentive programs, the Company\nrecorded $1.1 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion as a reduction to revenue and $142.5 million, $109.8 million and $64.7 million as sales and marketing\nexpense, respectively.\nRefunds\nFrom time to time the Company issues credits or refunds to riders unsatisfied by the level of service provided by the driver. There is no legal\nobligation to remunerate such riders nor does the Company issue such credits or refunds to riders on behalf of the drivers. The Company accounts for credits or\nrefunds, which are not recoverable from the drivers as sales and marketing expenses when incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nrider refunds were $19.7 million, $21.5 million and $19.1 million, respectively. The Company accounts for credits and refunds issued to Light Vehicle riders as\ncost of revenue and was $6.2 million, $7.8 million and $6.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists of costs directly related to revenue generating transactions through the Company\u2019s multimodal platform which primarily\nincludes insurance costs, payment processing charges, and other costs. Insurance costs consist of insurance generally required under TNC and city regulations\nfor ridesharing and bike and scooter rentals and also includes occupational hazard insurance for drivers. Payment processing charges include merchant fees,\nchargebacks and failed charges. Other costs included in cost of revenue are hosting and platform-related technology costs, vehicle lease expenses, personnel-\nrelated compensation costs, depreciation, amortization of technology-related intangible assets, asset write-off charges, and gains and losses related to the sale of\nvehicles.\nOperations and Support\nOperations and support expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs of local operations teams and teams who provide phone,\nemail and chat support to users, bike and scooter fleet operations support costs, driver background checks and onboarding costs, facility cost, certain car rental\nfleet support costs, and fees paid to third-parties providing operations support.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4761, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "279f65a2-3b91-4000-8ec7-3d2a0fb7e520": {"__data__": {"id_": "279f65a2-3b91-4000-8ec7-3d2a0fb7e520", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "86", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "67d4ac43-c793-4b71-903f-9a28dc57be19", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "86", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "843d5bb03a66d33e222dc21c0461d1dac171b4fe8553799f5ac6474f35ff52d4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2d9d2f92-65ea-4dc5-b750-d519488bf1f5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "86", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "d88f73fa3def07139a752763b44ac378ba598c5984a647128a10bf053db8b7f1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Insurance costs consist of insurance generally required under TNC and city regulations\nfor ridesharing and bike and scooter rentals and also includes occupational hazard insurance for drivers.

Sales and marketing costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising\nexpenses were $122.0 million, $162.1 million and $145.4 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs, professional services fees, certain insurance costs that\nare generally not required under TNC regulations, certain loss contingency expenses including legal accruals and settlements, insurance claims administrative\nfees, policy spend, depreciation, facility costs, and other corporate costs. General and administrative expenses are expensed as incurred.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company incurs stock-based compensation expense primarily from RSUs, PSUs, stock options, and ESPP purchase rights.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted to employees, directors, and consultants and ESPP purchase rights using the Black-\nScholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes model considers several variables and assumptions in estimating the fair value of stock-based awards. These\nvariables include:\n\u2022 per share fair value of the underlying common stock;\n\u2022 exercise price;\n\u2022 expected term;\n\u2022 risk-free interest rate;\n\u2022 expected annual dividend yield; and\n\u2022 expected stock price volatility over the expected term.\nThe Company estimates the expected term for stock options using the simplified method for \u201cplain vanilla\u201d stock option awards. The expected term of\nthe ESPP purchase rights is estimated using the period from the beginning of the offering period to the end of each purchase period. Since the Company has\nlimited history as a public company and does not yet have sufficient trading history for the Company's common stock, the Company estimates volatility for\nstock options and ESPP purchase rights using the historical volatility of the stock price of similar publicly traded peer companies. The risk-free interest rate is\nbased on the yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues similar in duration to the expected term of the stock options or ESPP purchase rights granted.\nThe fair value of stock options that are expected to vest is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service\nperiod. The Company recognizes compensation expense related to the ESPP purchase rights on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is typically\n12 months.\nThe fair value of RSUs and PSUs is estimated based on the fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of grant, which is\ndetermined based on the closing price of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock as reported on the date of grant.\nCompensation expense for RSUs is generally recognized based on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Stock-based compensation\nexpense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and reflects estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary,\nin subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are\nrecorded based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. These\ndifferences are measured using the enacted statutory tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which differences are expected to\nreverse. The Company recognizes the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company\nrecords a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the net amount that it believes is more-likely-than-not to be realized.

ASC 740-10 provides that a tax benefit from an\nuncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any\nrelated appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to the liability for unrecognized tax\nbenefits, if any, as a component of the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for its business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, allocation of\nthe fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition\ndate. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining\nthe fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.\nManagement\u2019s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a\nresult, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, the Company may record\nadjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new information is obtained related to facts and\ncircumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. After the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected on the consolidated statements of\noperations and comprehensive loss. Acquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash equivalents consist of institutional money market funds and certificates of deposits denominated in U.S. dollars as well as commercial paper and\ncorporate bonds. Cash equivalents are highly liquid, short-term investments having an original maturity of 90 days or less that are readily convertible to known\namounts of cash. Also included in cash and cash equivalents are cash in transit from payment processors for credit and debit card transactions.\nRestricted Cash and Cash Equivalents\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of amounts held in separate trust accounts and restricted bank accounts as collateral for\ninsurance purposes and amounts pledged to secure certain letters of credit.\nInvestments\nDebt Securities\nThe Company\u2019s accounting for its investments in debt securities is based on the legal form of the security, the Company\u2019s intended holding period for\nthe security, and the nature of the transaction. Investments in debt securities include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, corporate bonds and U.S.\ngovernment securities. Investments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value.\nThe Company considers an available-for-sale debt security to be impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost basis. The\nentire difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value of the Company\u2019s available-for-sale debt securities is recognized on the consolidated\nstatements of operations as an impairment if, (i) the fair value of the security is below its amortized cost and (ii) the Company intends to sell or is more likely\nthan not required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If neither criterion is met, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair\nvalue is due to credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which the security\u2019s fair value is less than\namortized cost, changes to the rating of the security by third-party rating agencies, and adverse conditions specific to the security, among other factors. If the\nCompany's assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the credit loss is measured based on the Company's best estimate of the cash flows expected to be\ncollected. When developing its estimate of cash flows expected to be collected, the Company considers all available information relevant to the collectability of\nthe security, including past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nCredit loss impairments are recognized through an allowance for credit losses adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the debt securities on the\nbalance sheet with an offsetting credit loss expense on the consolidated statements of operations.

Restricted investments are comprised of debt security investments in commercial paper, certificates of\ndeposit, corporate bonds and U.S. government securities which are held in trust accounts at third-party financial institutions pursuant to\ncertain contracts with insurance providers.\nNon-marketable Equity Securities\nThe Company has elected to measure its investments in non-marketable equity securities at cost, with remeasurements to fair value only upon the\noccurrence of observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. The Company qualitatively assesses whether\nindicators of impairment exist. Factors considered in this assessment include the investees\u2019 financial and liquidity position, access to capital resources, and\nmacroeconomic conditions, among others. If an impairment exists, the Company estimates the fair value of the investment by using the best information\navailable, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data, and recognizes a loss for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds\nthe fair value of the investment on the consolidated statements of operations.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nThe Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Although the Company\ndeposits its cash with multiple financial institutions, the deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses\non its deposits of cash and cash equivalents. Management believes that the institutions are financially stable and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists. The\nCompany limits purchases of debt securities to investment-grade securities.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price, which represents the amount that would be received on the\nsale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market\nparticipants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring\nfair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis, whereby inputs used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level. The following are the\nhierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value:\nLevel 1Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2Inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active\nmarkets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by\nobservable market data by correlation or other means.\nLevel 3Unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to determine fair value. These assumptions are\nrequired to be consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available.\nThe carrying values of the Company\u2019s accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities approximate their respective fair values due to the short\nperiod of time to payment.\n89", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3889, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f3426f98-641c-425c-a8b6-bf537f19251a": {"__data__": {"id_": "f3426f98-641c-425c-a8b6-bf537f19251a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "90", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "450de814-1f9f-4676-ae8d-28b09d6cf1a0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "90", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "77628bad8acbad6c84155a9a5199fcceb08c39c70854b5b398dcadf5ff87ff19", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "659008d3-0195-4cc0-bf7b-3db21b96517f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8ddf67e5720f6dd0d3e6c5f17638aeff439b880de425c4db9dd7f3739f8fcde1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Light Vehicle Fleet\nThe Company\u2019s Light Vehicle fleet consists of bikes and scooters.

Bikes are included in property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets.\nLeases\nIn accordance with ASC 842, the Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception by assessing whether the\narrangement contains an identified asset and whether the lessee has the right to control such asset. The Company determines the classification and measurement\nof its leases upon lease commencement. The Company enters into certain agreements as a lessor and either leases or subleases the underlying asset in the\nagreement to customers. The Company also enters into certain agreements as a lessee. If any of the following criteria are met, the Company classifies the lease\nas a financing lease (as a lessee) or as a direct financing or sales-type lease (both as a lessor):\n\u2022The lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term;\n\u2022The lease grants the lessee an option to purchase the underlying asset that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise;\n\u2022The lease term is for 75% or more of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset, unless the commencement date falls within the last 25% of\nthe economic life of the underlying asset;\n\u2022The present value of the sum of the lease payments equals or exceeds 90% of the fair value of the underlying asset; or\n\u2022The underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term.\nLeases that do not meet any of the above criteria are accounted for as operating leases.\nLessor\nThe Company's lease arrangements include vehicle rentals to drivers or renters under the Flexdrive program and Light Vehicle rentals to single-use\nriders. Due to the short-term nature of these arrangements, the Company classifies these leases as operating leases. The Company does not separate lease and\nnon-lease components, such as insurance or roadside assistance provided to the lessee, in its lessor lease arrangements. Lease payments are primarily fixed and\nare recognized as revenue in the period over which the lease arrangement occurs. Taxes or other fees assessed by governmental authorities that are both\nimposed on and concurrent with each lease revenue-producing transaction and collected by the Company from the lessee are excluded from the consideration\nin its lease arrangements. The Company mitigates residual value risk of its leased assets by performing regular maintenance and repairs, as necessary, and\nthrough periodic reviews of asset depreciation rates based on the Company's ongoing assessment of present and estimated future market conditions.\nLessee\nThe Company's leases include real estate property to support its operations and Flexdrive vehicles that may be used by drivers to provide ridesharing\nservices on the Lyft Platform. For leases with a term greater than 12 months, the Company records the related right-of-use asset and lease liability at the present\nvalue of lease payments over the term. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will\nexercise such options.

The interest\ncomponent of finance leases is included in cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations and recognized using the effective interest method over\nthe lease term. Variable lease payments are recognized primarily in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.\nSimilar to other long-lived assets discussed below, the Company measures recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the\nfuture undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate. If the carrying value of the assets are not recoverable, the impairment\nrecognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. For leased assets, such circumstances would include the\ndecision to leave a leased facility prior to the end of the minimum lease term or subleases for which estimated cash flows do not fully cover the costs of the\nassociated lease. The Company committed to a decision to exit and sublease or cease use of certain facilities to align with the Company\u2019s anticipated operating\nneeds and incurred impairment charges related to real estate operating right-of-use assets of $13.0 million and $55.3 million during the years ended December\n31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 16 \u201cRestructuring\u201d to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using a straight-line method over the estimated\nuseful life of the related asset, which is generally between one and eight years. Depreciation for property and equipment commences once they are ready for\nour intended use. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, and improvements and betterments are capitalized. When assets are retired or\notherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheet and any resulting gain or loss is reflected on the\nconsolidated statement of operations in the period realized. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the term of the\nlease, or the useful life of the assets. Construction in progress is related to property and equipment that has not yet been placed in service for its intended use.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business\ncombination. Intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of entities are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting based on management\u2019s\nestimate of the fair value of assets received. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives which range from two to\ntwelve years.\nGoodwill is not subject to amortization, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate the carrying value of the reporting unit may be in excess of its fair value. As part of the annual goodwill impairment test, the Company\nfirst performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. If, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more-\nlikely-than-not that the fair value of the Company\u2019s reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required.\nAlternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test. There was no impairment of goodwill recorded\nfor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in\nbusiness circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Such events and changes may include: significant changes\nin performance relative to expected operating results, changes in asset use, negative industry or economic trends, and changes in the Company\u2019s business\nstrategy. The Company measures recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the\nasset group are expected to generate. If the carrying value of the assets are not recoverable, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the\ncarrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. With the exception of impairment charges related to real estate operating right-of-use assets discussed above,\nthere was no other material impairment of long-lived assets recorded for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nSoftware Development Costs\nThe Company incurs costs related to developing the Lyft Platform and related support systems.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5065, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e69b9f7d-5d78-4361-91be-cf4e1e54a064": {"__data__": {"id_": "e69b9f7d-5d78-4361-91be-cf4e1e54a064", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "91", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "12f81c92-01c2-4b7f-bb06-ddc79c7e6e70", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "91", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "556b2a4dfe032ef3b1d9532539a1b95b49d4fedaac42d5cb34cc03cad2d9efa4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a05eeeb4-391a-4855-ac65-fdb60d5503fa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "91", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "dfa45c0567c7453fd20d827ec96d781b7ec2c0b8f8c353ffdfaa9ccae026632b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Such events and changes may include: significant changes\nin performance relative to expected operating results, changes in asset use, negative industry or economic trends, and changes in the Company\u2019s business\nstrategy.

The\nrecorded liabilities reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported and any estimable\nadministrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments. Liabilities are determined on a quarterly basis by internal\nactuaries through an analysis of historical trends, and changes in claims experience, including consideration of new information and application of loss\ndevelopment factors, and frequency and severity assumptions, among other inputs and assumptions for the insurance reserves and insurance-related accruals.\nOn an annual basis or more frequently as determined by management, an independent third-party actuary will evaluate the liabilities for appropriateness with\nclaims reserve valuations.\nInsurance claims may take years to completely settle, and the Company has available limited historical loss experience because of the limited\noperational history. The Company makes certain assumptions based on currently available information and industry statistics, with the loss development factors\nas the most significant assumption related to the insurance reserves and the frequency and severity assumptions as the most significant assumptions related to\ninsurance-related accruals, and utilizes actuarial models and techniques to estimate the reserves. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim,\nincluding the length of time the claim remains open, economic and healthcare cost trends and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge\nin future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections. The impact of these factors on ultimate costs for\ninsurance is difficult to estimate and could be material. However, while the Company believes that the insurance reserve and insurance-related accrual amounts\nare adequate, the ultimate liabilities may be in excess of, or less than, the amounts provided. As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle\nthe liabilities and when amounts will be paid may significantly vary from the estimated amounts provided for on the consolidated balance sheets. For example,\ndisruptive factors may distort data, metrics and patterns and result in rapid increases in insurance cost and reserve deficiency. These disruptive factors can\ninclude recent economic conditions and ongoing global events such as the high inflationary environment, increased litigation, and higher than expected losses\nacross the commercial auto industry. The Company continues to review its insurance estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical loss experience\ndevelops, additional claims are reported and settled, and the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves.\nOn April 22, 2021, PVIC entered into a Reinsurance Agreement with DARAG, under which DARAG reinsured a legacy portfolio of auto insurance\npolicies, based on reserves in place as of March 31, 2021, for $183.2 million of coverage above the liabilities recorded as of that date (the \u201cReinsurance\nTransaction\u201d). Under the terms of the Reinsurance Agreement, PVIC ceded to DARAG approximately $251.3 million of certain legacy insurance liabilities for\npolicies underwritten during the period of October 1, 2018 to October 1, 2020, with an aggregate limit of $434.5 million, for a premium of $271.5 million.\nLosses ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement that exceed $271.5 million, but are below the aggregate limit of $434.5 million, resulted in the recognition of a\ndeferred gain liability. The deferred gain liability was amortized and recognized as a benefit to the statement of operations over the estimated remaining\nsettlement period of the ceded reserves. The settlement period of the ceded reserves was based on the life-to-date cumulative losses collected and likely extends\nover periods longer than a quarter. The amount of the deferral that was amortized was recalculated each period based on loss payments and updated estimates\nof the portfolio\u2019s total losses. When the amount and timing of the reinsurance recoveries were uncertain, the recovery method was used to calculate the amount\nof amortization in period. The deferral of gains had a negative impact in the respective period to cost of revenue as the losses on direct liabilities were not offset\nby gains from excess benefits under the Reinsurance Agreement. The amortization of these deferred gains provided a benefit to cost of revenue over multiple\nperiods equal to the excess benefits received. Deferred gain liabilities for the Reinsurance Transaction were included in accruals and other current liabilities on\nthe consolidated balance sheets.\nOn June 21, 2022, PVIC and DARAG completed a transaction to effectively commute and settle the previous Reinsurance Agreement.

The two-class method determines net loss per common share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to\ndividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders\nfor the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the\nperiod had been distributed. The Company had no participating securities outstanding during any of the periods presented.\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the\nperiod. The diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the period. For periods in which the\nCompany reports net losses, diluted net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per common share attributable\nto common stockholders, because potentially dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive.\n92", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4236, "end_char_idx": 6548, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "51fcc072-22ce-4490-8322-94514272cb08": {"__data__": {"id_": "51fcc072-22ce-4490-8322-94514272cb08", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "93", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6290b9af-1727-4a26-841c-169daa3dd39f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "93", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "136cb8053ef4ab6331f3e55a69ea1217a99347b6ee892cae1442b41bd41c112d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "58bc6e52-c0cd-4ec9-8adc-f0a482f63cb5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2dd6c7b5b25f2d783fc18e92ffde46dd3d1c8b1d670255fbd1487dd09143c654", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Variable Interest Entities\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810, Consolidation (\u201cASC 810\u201d), the Company evaluates its ownership, contractual and\nother interests in entities to assess whether it has a variable interest in entities in which it has a financial relationship and, if so, whether or not those entities are\nvariable interest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d). These evaluations are complex, involving judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical\nand prospective information, among other factors. For an entity to qualify as a VIE, ASC 810 requires the Company to determine if the Company is the primary\nbeneficiary of the VIE, and, if so, to consolidate such entity into its consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company consolidates VIEs in which it has a controlling financial interest and is therefore deemed the primary beneficiary. A controlling\nfinancial interest will have both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the VIE activities that most significantly impact economic performance;\nand (b) the obligation to absorb the VIE losses and the right to receive benefits that are significant to the VIE. Periodically, the Company reevaluates its\nownership, contractual and other interests in entities to determine whether any changes in its interest or relationship with an entity impacts the determination of\nwhether it is still the primary beneficiary of such entity. The Company has determined that it was the primary beneficiary of one VIE as of December 31, 2023.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2020-06, \u201cDebt\u2014Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic\n470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging\u2014 Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an\nEntity\u2019s Own Equity\u201d, which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by eliminating the requirement to separate embedded conversion features\nfrom the host contract when the conversion features are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do\nnot result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital. By removing the separation model, a convertible debt instrument will be reported as a single\nliability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. This new standard also removes certain settlement conditions that are\nrequired for contracts to qualify for equity classification and simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculations by requiring that an entity use the if-\nconverted method and that the effect of potential share settlement be included in diluted earnings per share calculations. This new standard is effective for the\nCompany for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this standard effective\nJanuary 1, 2022, using the modified retrospective method. In the consolidated balance sheets, the adoption of this new guidance resulted in:\n\u2022an increase of $133.5 million to the total carrying value of the convertible senior notes to reflect the full principal amount of the convertible senior\nnotes outstanding net of issuance costs,\n\u2022a reduction of $140.0 million (net of tax) to additional paid-in capital to remove the equity component separately recorded for the conversion features\nassociated with the convertible senior notes, and\n\u2022a cumulative-effect adjustment of $6.5 million (net of tax) to the beginning balance of accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2022.\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, \u201cBusiness Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities\nfrom Contracts with Customers\u201d (\u201cASU 2021-08\u201d), which requires companies to apply the definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606, Revenue\nfrom Contracts with Customers, to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities relating to contracts with customers that are acquired in a\nbusiness combination. This will result in the acquirer recording acquired contract assets and liabilities on the same basis that would have been recorded by the\nacquiree before the acquisition under ASC 606.

The acquisition was treated as a business combination and increases the Company\u2019s scale in micromobility by\nleveraging PBSC\u2019s deep sales experience and customer relationships.\nAcquisition costs were immaterial and are included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, the Company paid out earn out incentives of $15.0 million, which were previously included in contingent\nconsideration on the consolidated balance sheet. The earn out incentives were based on hardware and software for new system sales, either earned or\ncommitted during the earn out period.\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the Closing Date (in thousands):\nCash and cash equivalents $ 2,665 \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 34,845 \nOther investments 22,175 \nProperty and equipment 2,202 \nOperating lease right-of-use assets 786 \nIdentifiable intangible assets 45,047 \nTotal identifiable assets acquired 107,720 \nAccounts payable 6,004 \nAccrued and other liabilities 3,344 \nOperating lease liabilities \u2014 current 292 \nOperating lease liabilities 494 \nOther liabilities 14,678 \nTotal liabilities assumed 24,812 \nNon-controlling interest (recorded to equity) 140 \nNet assets assumed 82,768 \nGoodwill 80,748 \nTotal acquisition consideration $ 163,516 \nThe Company concluded the purchase accounting for the acquisition of PBSC during the second quarter of 2023.

No individual security incurred\ncontinuous unrealized losses for greater than 12 months.\nThe Company purchases investment grade marketable debt securities which are rated by nationally recognized statistical credit rating organizations in\naccordance with its investment policy. This policy is designed to minimize the Company's exposure to credit losses. As of December 31, 2023, the credit-\nquality of the Company\u2019s marketable available-for-sale debt securities had remained stable. The unrealized losses recognized on marketable available-for-sale\ndebt securities as of December 31, 2023 were primarily related to the continued market volatility associated with uncertain economic outlook. The contractual\nterms of these investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost basis of the investments and it is not expected\nthat the investments would be settled at a price less than their amortized cost basis. The Company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more\nlikely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis. The Company is not aware of any\nspecific event or circumstance that would require the Company to change its quarterly assessment of credit losses for any marketable available-for-sale debt\nsecurity as of December 31, 2023. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and will be recognized on the\nconsolidated financial statements as soon as they become known.

(\u201cPVIC\u201d), entered into a Quota Share\nReinsurance Agreement (the \u201cReinsurance Agreement\u201d) with DARAG Bermuda LTD (\u201cDARAG\u201d), under which DARAG reinsured a legacy portfolio of auto\ninsurance policies, based on reserves in place as of March 31, 2021, for $183.2 million of coverage above the liabilities recorded as of that date. Under the\nterms of the Reinsurance Agreement, PVIC ceded to DARAG approximately $251.3 million of certain legacy insurance liabilities for policies underwritten\nduring the period of October 1, 2018 to October 1, 2020, with an aggregate limit of $434.5 million, for a premium of $271.5 million (\u201cthe Reinsurance\nTransaction\u201d). The Reinsurance Agreement was on a funds withheld basis, meaning that funds are withheld by PVIC from the insurance premium owed to\nDARAG in order to pay future reinsurance claims on DARAG\u2019s behalf.

The\nCompany has agreed to indemnify and defend the indemnified party\u2019s claims and related losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party resulting from\nactual or threatened third-party claims because of the Company\u2019s activities or, in some cases, non-compliance with certain representations and warranties made\nby the Company. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to the Company\u2019s limited history of\nprior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. To date, losses recorded on the consolidated\nstatements of operations in connection with the indemnification provisions have not been material.\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company is currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory and governmental inquiries and\ninvestigations in the ordinary course of business, including suits by drivers, riders, renters, third parties and governmental entities (individually or as class\nactions) alleging, among other things, various wage and expense related claims, violations of state or federal laws, improper disclosure of the Company\u2019s fees,\nrules or policies, that such fees, rules or policies violate applicable law, or that the Company has not acted in conformity with such fees, rules or policies, as\nwell as proceedings related to product liability, antitrust, its acquisitions, securities issuances or business practices, or public disclosures about the Company or\nthe Company's business. In addition, the Company has been, and is currently, named as a defendant in a number of litigation matters related to allegations of\naccidents or other trust and safety incidents involving drivers or riders using the Lyft Platform.\nThe outcomes of the Company\u2019s legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. For certain matters for which a\nmaterial loss is reasonably possible, an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses is not possible nor is the Company able to estimate the loss or range of\nlosses that could potentially result from the application of nonmonetary remedies. For matters where the Company has recorded a probable and estimable loss,\nuntil the final resolution of the matter, there may be exposure to a material loss in excess of the amount recorded.\nIndependent Contractor Classification Matters\nWith regard to independent contractor classification of drivers on the Lyft Platform, the Company is regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration\nproceedings, administrative actions, government investigations and other legal and regulatory proceedings at the federal, state and municipal levels challenging\nthe classification of these drivers as independent contractors, and claims that, by the alleged misclassification, the Company has violated various labor and\nother laws that would apply to driver employees. Laws and regulations that govern the status and classification of independent contractors are subject to change\nand divergent interpretations by various authorities, which can create uncertainty and unpredictability for the Company.\nFor example, California Assembly Bill 5 (now codified in part at Cal. Labor Code sec. 2775) codified and extended an employment classification test\nset forth by the California Supreme Court that established a new standard for determining employee or independent contractor status. The passage of this bill\nled to additional challenges to the independent contractor classification of drivers using the Lyft Platform. For example, on May 5, 2020, the California\nAttorney General and the City Attorneys of Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco filed a lawsuit against the Company and Uber for allegedly\nmisclassifying drivers on the companies\u2019 respective platforms as independent contractors in violation of Assembly Bill 5 and California\u2019s Unfair Competition\nLaw, and on August 5, 2020, the California Labor Commissioner filed lawsuits against the Company and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers on the\ncompanies\u2019 respective platforms as independent contractors, seeking injunctive relief and material damages and penalties. On August 10, 2020, the court\ngranted a motion for a preliminary injunction, forcing the Company and Uber to reclassify drivers in California as employees until the end of the lawsuit.\nSubsequently, voters in California approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provided a framework for drivers utilizing platforms like Lyft to\nmaintain their status as independent contractors under California law. Proposition 22 went into effect on December 16, 2020. On April 20, 2021, the court\ngranted the parties\u2019 joint request to dissolve the preliminary injunction in light of the passage of Proposition 22. On May 5, 2021, the California Labor\nCommissioner filed a petition to coordinate its lawsuit with the Attorney General lawsuit and three other cases against the Company and Uber.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5328, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "490275a0-9121-4109-acbf-fe20ee971ded": {"__data__": {"id_": "490275a0-9121-4109-acbf-fe20ee971ded", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "66f8c4d0-37ae-437a-a623-5aa8cd38d61a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "6348936529c59528d31b8baddcf12ab36106d0753051090078179f79cf1cd693", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a7b77185-2d7b-4e45-b112-de60013a0ccc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "94405ec6008fa7defd7ec12af336a1559b17600021d5585df757288486f97a3a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "On August 10, 2020, the court\ngranted a motion for a preliminary injunction, forcing the Company and Uber to reclassify drivers in California as employees until the end of the lawsuit.\nSubsequently, voters in California approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provided a framework for drivers utilizing platforms like Lyft to\nmaintain their status as independent contractors under California law.

Separately, on July 14, 2020, the\nMassachusetts Attorney General filed a lawsuit against the Company and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers as independent contractors under\nMassachusetts law, and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The Company and Uber filed motions to dismiss, which were denied by the court in March\n2021. The case is set for trial on May 13, 2024. Certain adverse outcomes of such actions would have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial\ncondition and results of operations, including damages, penalties and potential suspension of operations in impacted jurisdictions, including California or\nMassachusetts. The Company\u2019s chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated. Such\nregulatory scrutiny or action may create different or conflicting obligations from one jurisdiction to another.\nThe New York Attorney General has alleged misrepresentations related to certain fees and related driver pay deductions, as well as misclassification of\ndrivers and related labor law violations in New York. The Company has entered into an agreement to resolve this matter, under which New York drivers will\nreceive new benefits and maintain their flexibility as independent contractors. The amount accrued for these matters is recorded within accrued and other\ncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023.\nThe Company is currently involved in a number of putative class actions, thousands of individual claims, including those brought in arbitration or\ncompelled pursuant to the Company's Terms of Service to arbitration, matters brought, in whole or in part, as representative actions under California\u2019s Private\nAttorneys General Act, Labor Code Section 2698, et seq., alleging that the Company misclassified drivers as independent contractors and other matters\nchallenging the classification of drivers on the Company\u2019s platform as independent contractors. The Company is currently defending allegations in a number of\nlawsuits that the Company has failed to properly classify drivers and provide those drivers with sick leave and related benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Company\u2019s chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated.\nThe Company disputes any allegations of wrongdoing and intends to continue to defend itself vigorously in these matters. However, results of\nlitigation, arbitration and regulatory actions are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to these driver claims, individually or in the aggregate,\ncould have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and arbitration of\nthese matters can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management\nresources and other factors.\nUnemployment Insurance Assessment\nThe Company is involved in administrative audits with various state employment agencies, including audits related to driver classification, in\nCalifornia, Oregon, Wisconsin, Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The Company believes that drivers are properly classified as independent\ncontractors and plans to vigorously contest any adverse assessment or determination. The Company\u2019s chances of success on the merits are still uncertain. The\nCompany accrues for liabilities that may result from assessments by, or any negotiated agreements with, these employment agencies when a loss is probable\nand reasonably estimable, and the expense is recorded to general and administrative expenses.\nIn 2018, the New Jersey Department of Labor & Workforce Development (\u201cNJDOL\u201d) opened an audit reviewing whether drivers were independent\ncontractors or employees for purposes of determining whether unemployment insurance regulations apply from 2014 through March 31, 2018. The NJDOL\nissued an assessment on June 4, 2019 and subsequently issued an updated assessment on March 31, 2021. The assessment was calculated through April 30,\n2019, but only calculated the alleged contributions, penalties, and interests owed from 2014 through 2017. The Company filed a petition to challenge the\nassessment, and are awaiting a hearing. The Company has also submitted payment for the principal revised amount of the assessment to stop interest from\naccruing on this amount.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5088, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "89895d6e-85d7-46cc-8162-6831ed300ea8": {"__data__": {"id_": "89895d6e-85d7-46cc-8162-6831ed300ea8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "109", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f17cdd1e-4bc6-475b-b92c-2f07fb7e101f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "109", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "6d65272806b41a3f52843f98108071d920ad188c1478388730eeffe697c91292", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d972f037-ce1a-494b-acc4-21f3f449037d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "109", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "b55070fab1abcbdc66030e2907a08827e12be2657deddd825c63458595c086d1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In 2018, the New Jersey Department of Labor & Workforce Development (\u201cNJDOL\u201d) opened an audit reviewing whether drivers were independent\ncontractors or employees for purposes of determining whether unemployment insurance regulations apply from 2014 through March 31, 2018.

The Company disputes any allegation of wrongdoing and intends to defend itself vigorously in these\nmatters. The Company\u2019s chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated.\nOther Class Actions and Consumer Matters\nFrom time to time, the Company becomes involved in putative class actions alleging violations of consumer protection, civil rights, and other laws;\nantitrust and unfair competition laws such as California\u2019s Cartwright Act, Unfair Practices Act and Unfair Competition Law; and the Americans with\nDisabilities Act, or the ADA, among others. In 2021, the Company received a favorable outcome in a case in the Northern District of California alleging ADA\nviolations with respect to Lyft\u2019s wheelchair accessible vehicle (\u201cWAV\u201d) offerings in three Bay Area counties, Independent Living Resource Center San\nFrancisco (\u201cILRC\u201d) v. Lyft, Inc. After hearing evidence at a 5-day bench trial, the court ruled that plaintiffs failed their burden to prove that Lyft violates the\nADA. The plaintiffs did not appeal the ruling. Lyft is facing a similar ADA lawsuit seeking injunctive and other relief in the Southern District of New York,\nLowell v. Lyft, Inc. On March 24, 2023, the court certified three classes encompassing regions where Lyft does not currently offer WAV service (Westchester\nCounty, NY; New York State except New York City; and all other \u201cnon-WAV\u201d regions in the U.S.).

The Company is currently named as a defendant in a number of matters related to accidents or other incidents involving drivers,\nriders, renters and third parties.

There is no pending or threatened claim that has arisen from these accidents or incidents that individually, in the Company\u2019s\nopinion, is likely to have a material impact on its business, financial condition or results of operations; however, results of litigation and claims are inherently\nunpredictable and legal proceedings related to such accidents or incidents, in the aggregate, could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial\ncondition and results of operations. For example, on January 17, 2020, the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, granted the petition of multiple\nplaintiffs to coordinate their claims relating to alleged sexual assault or harassment by drivers on the Lyft Platform, and a Judicial Council Coordinated\nProceeding has been created before the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, where the claims of multiple plaintiffs are currently pending.\nRegardless of the outcome of these or other matters, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs\nindividually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources and other factors.

Additionally in the event of a corporate event\nconstituting a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture), holders of the 2025 Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their\n2025 Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2025 Notes being repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but\nexcluding, the repurchase date.\nPrior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, the Company separated the 2025 Notes into a liability and an equity component. At the date of issuance, the\nCompany determined the fair value of the liability component to be $558.3 million calculated as the present value of future cash flows discounted at the\nborrowing rate for a similar nonconvertible debt instrument. The equity component representing the conversion option was $189.2 million and was determined\nby deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the 2025 Notes. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to\nmeet the conditions for equity classification. The difference between the principal amount of the 2025 Notes and the liability component (\u201cdebt discount\u201d) was\namortized to interest expense over the contractual term at an effective interest rate of 8.0%.\nFollowing the adoption of ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2022, the Company no longer bifurcates the 2025 Notes, but rather accounts for the conversion\nfeature as a single debt instrument. The difference between the carrying amount and face value of the liability results in a reduced liability component.\nTherefore, less interest expense is being recorded each period from January 1, 2022 to maturity and the equity component is now classified as debt, eliminating\nthe subsequent amortization of the debt discount as interest expense. Accordingly, the Company recorded a net decrease to additional paid-in capital of\napproximately $140.0 million, net of tax, to remove the equity component separately recorded for the conversion features associated with the 2025 Notes and\nequity component associated with the issuance costs, an increase of approximately $133.5 million in the carrying value of the 2025 Notes to reflect the full\nprincipal amount, net of issuance costs, and an increase to accumulated deficit of approximately $6.5 million, net of tax in the Company\u2019s consolidated balance\nsheet with no impact to the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations.\nDebt issuance costs related to the 2025 Notes totaled $14.3 million at inception and were comprised of discounts and commissions payable to the\ninitial purchasers and third-party offering costs and will be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual term. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the unamortized debt discount and debt issuance cost of the 2025 Notes was 4.0 million on the consolidated balance sheet.\nThe last reported sale price of the Company's Class A common stock exceeded 130% of the conversion price of the 2025 Notes for at least 20 trading\ndays during the 30 consecutive trading day period ended June 30, 2021.

The Company determined that PBSC is the primary beneficiary of one of the acquired\nVIEs, in which it owns an 80% equity interest, as PBSC has the power to direct the majority of the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its\neconomic performance, the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits. As PBSC is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the assets, liabilities,\nnon-controlling interest, revenues and operating results are included in the consolidated financial statements. During the quarter ended September 30, 2022,\nPBSC entered into another joint venture deemed to be a VIE which was accounted for under the equity method which was immaterial.\nThe acquisition date fair value of the VIEs acquired as part of the PBSC acquisition was $22.2 million, which exceeds the carrying value and is\nrecorded within other investments in the consolidated balance sheet. The maximum potential financial statement loss the Company would incur if these VIEs\nwere to default on all their obligations would be the loss of the carrying value of these investments as well as any current or future investments, if any, PBSC\nwere to make which was immaterial as of December 31, 2023.\nOther than the VIE of which PBSC owns an 80% equity interest, the Company has determined that PBSC does not direct the activities that would\nsignificantly affect the economic performance of these VIEs. Therefore, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs. As a result, the Company\naccounts for its investment in these VIEs under the equity method, and they are not consolidated into the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. In\naddition, the Company recognizes its proportionate share of the reported profits or losses of these VIEs in other income (expense), net in the consolidated\nstatements of operations, and as an adjustment to its investment in VIEs in the consolidated balance sheets. The profits and losses of these unconsolidated VIEs\nwere not material to the consolidated statements of operations for the period ended December 31, 2023.\nOther VIEs\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, the Company contributed a business to a privately held company in exchange for an equity interest and a seat on\nthe board of directors of such company. This privately held company was determined to be a VIE for which the Company lacks the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the entity\u2019s economic performance. As the Company is not the primary beneficiary, it does not consolidate the VIE.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4067, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "59d83f94-a273-4be5-9613-1a3891860896": {"__data__": {"id_": "59d83f94-a273-4be5-9613-1a3891860896", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "122", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c989296d-1547-4f2f-b5b6-6c468f12f12e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "122", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "cedc0560468a061ff9f3a4b85225e081a77806d3fcd7812b2f901137885dd602", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5b808c6d-2476-40be-a75a-4465b726a0d3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "122", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "3b76ea1626c85c39d4cd82fec1603a324a38bc2c03f9e167934023b8f9ca2d20", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In\naddition, the Company recognizes its proportionate share of the reported profits or losses of these VIEs in other income (expense), net in the consolidated\nstatements of operations, and as an adjustment to its investment in VIEs in the consolidated balance sheets.

Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act),\nas of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial\nofficer have concluded that as of December 31, 2023, due to a deficiency related to the review of our forward-looking, non-GAAP directional commentary for\nfiscal year 2024 that resulted in a clerical error (the \u201cClerical Error\u201d) in our press release announcing our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year\n2023 which was furnished with our Current Report on Form 8-K dated February 13, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at a\nreasonable assurance level.\nThe Clerical Error was promptly corrected on our earnings call and in an updated press release and supplemental slides on February 13, 2024 and in\nan amendment to the Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 14, 2024. The Clerical Error is unrelated to our internal control over financial reporting. In\norder to remediate the deficiency, we will design and implement additional review procedures over forward-looking directional commentary. As of February\n20, 2024, we believe that the actions we have taken, and plan to take, will remediate this deficiency.\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and\n15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nour financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples.\nOur management, under the supervision of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of\nour internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over\nfinancial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an\nindependent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management\u2019s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-\n15(d) of the Exchange Act during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or\nour internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only\nreasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are\nresource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no\nevaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations\ninclude the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally,\ncontrols can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The\ndesign of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any\ndesign will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4968, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "efd8b861-c6ef-49e5-af40-40e15839ab5e": {"__data__": {"id_": "efd8b861-c6ef-49e5-af40-40e15839ab5e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "123", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f123655a-57df-4059-8797-500437ef914d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "123", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "9de64512e9d4634735770aea42dde675adbae4a915a9f2bc30fbfc0acd7ca139", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e49a976c-8d85-4726-bc6b-aad897f4a3cb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "123", "file_name": "lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_path": "Data/10k/lyft_10k_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1462296, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "826d19cc1ca1b04a0c2e57ded36fff3c5d704ec225928a3c7da3a8cf3fd9334a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no\nevaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
